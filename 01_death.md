# Chapter 1: Death 

```
We shall not cease from exploration
And the end of all our exploring
Will be to arrive where we started
And know the place for the first time
```
<sup><sub>T.S. Eliot</sub></sup>

## The Question

**Albert Camus** once stated there is but one philosophical question and that is suicide. He meant this in the rhetorical sense in order to examine the absurdity of living in a universe where you are fated from the very start to die at the end. Nevertheless, there is a definite nearness to truth in his statement. Death is the fundamental bedrock at the bottom of Being and it is because of this the human is condemned to face mortality. From this and because of this, all things proceed. A Being cannot exist without the phantom of Death haunting its every moment in time. Only in the sequel, once reflective consciousness enters into the equation, do we ask whether or not a life always imperilled is worth living.

Despite being the foundation of almost every human pathology, Death as a field of inquiry has received comparatively little analysis over the course of history, except in the medical sciences where it is treated clinically, i.e. as a `thing-in-itself`, to be catalogued and diagnosed along with all the other maladies and diseases and thus placed into a knowable relation with the rest of existence, or in the spiritual studies, where it is mythologized and understood only through metaphor, but never as a phenomenon.

There is a reason for this. Death as a subject is repellant to understanding. Its very definition presupposes the limit of the knower, that is to say, Death is inherently unknowable. Death can only be understood through the mechanisms of analogy and metaphor, for when we turn our attention to the object of Death it reveals itself as something which can not be found in Being. We can be aware that we will eventually die, we can perceive Death from outside its domain, we can even in unique circumstances perceive the manner of our own Death, but that awareness will never be extended into Death itself. Death is the point where awareness stops; in this way, we mean Death exists beyond the limit of understanding. To ask questions about a subject that perpetually recedes from all attempts to know it necessarily entails the admission that no answers can ever be conceived, much less known. The inevitable end result will be to arrive where we started, having gained nothing; If any proposition can lay claim to human nature, this is it. 

## A Kantian Counterargument

A counterargument may be raised along these lines: a rock, by the same token, is incomprehensible since it exists beyond the sphere of knowability. As **Immanual Kant** demonstrated and **Arthur Schopenhauer** refined, all knowledge is only knowledge of our representation of Being, the reflection of its objectification in the sense data, the enumeration of objects through the medium of form. We do not know the world as it is; we only know the world as it appears. This is the distinction between `noumena`, the _existent_, and the `phenomena`, the _appearance_, that **Kant** famously discovered, or at least put to paper before anyone else. Thus, the interiority of a rock, its _existence_, is by definition beyond the limits of our Being, as we can only ever apprehend its appearance, but we do not thus claim a rock cannot be understood, or else mechanics would be a mere fiction. 

We can approach the rock, interact with it and thereby come to an understanding of its nature. We can discover its boundaries, the surface across which it begins and we end. We can feel its nature acting when we pick it up, along the lines of force that pull it back towards it gravitional focus. When we push on the rock, it pushes back and impinges on our senses. Its inertia becomes tangible in our grasp. It is only in the sense that we cannot _be_ the rock, that it is separate from us; there is imposed between us a `nihil privativum`, a Nothing that defines the boundaries between the things in our representation of our Being and our Being itself.

Death is not like this. It has no boundaries in space. It cannot be approached. It cannot be probed. It has no weight to be felt, no surface to touch. There is no way to know what is on the other side of it, or even if there is another side, for Death has no reflection in sensation. If Death has its own interiority, there is no mechanism to be found in the totality of existence for measuring it. For as **Wittgenstein** once said, "_the picture cannot place itself outside of its form of representation_" ([p.98, 2.174, _Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus_](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/5740/5740-pdf.pdf)).

## A Platonic Counterargument

A further counterargument may be made by the **Platonists**: If Death cannot be approached or felt, this does not signify a rupture in Being, a fundamental horror woven into the fabric of existence, for this is also the nature of concepts. Ephemeral ideas like honor and duty cannot be approached. You cannot probe the interiority of love. These things nonetheless exist, not concretely as in the case of physical matter, i.e. as objects, but abstractly, through the reflection of consciousness, i.e. as concepts. They become existent in our Being despite their lack of "_substance_", as it were, first as awareness through the objectification of the sense data and then as consciousness through the classification of the represented objects into concepts. 

This is the nature of conception, what Heidegger called `readiness-to-hand` and Schopenhauer the `principle of sufficient reason`: a concept exists in relation to the complex it is conceptualizing and its Being for us is exactly this relation abstracted into pure form. So we see a pencil poised over a sheet of paper and immediately apprehend the concept of writing in the relation that joins the tip of the pencil to surface of the paper. This is not the only interpretation of the relation between the two objects here, for conceptualization and the branching relations that form its basis are not a definite process but perpetually efferverscent. However, we will defer discussion of this poiunt until [later](#wittenstein), where it is not so out of place.

Instead, the reader's attention is drawn only to the fact in the preceding that a concept exists in a logical form where it refers to the representations of our Being and explains some aspect of the relation that defines the class of objects thus being enumerated. The thing which all instances have in common is the concept.

To make the existence of abstraction more apparent, we consider a concept whose existence is not up for the debate, or is at least tacitly assumed by all to have some passing claim to existence. In the same way **Platonic** Ideals are perceived, the concept of Number is never directly observed, only its manifestations. The concept of Number is an abstraction over a disjunction in existence, a union of partitions otherwise separate: The concept of two occurs in the complex of a bicycle as well it does in that of human eyes or sexual reproduction or the electrons in a helium atom, disparate phenomena that share only one commonality. If we substract the differences from these particular manifestations so that we are only left with what they have in common, the residue is exactly Number. By way of analogy, love is what remains when the bride and groom have been negated, when the content of the world has been removed and all that is left is the bare relation, its intentional form; A concept is the meaning of a particular class of forms; A concept is the abstraction of a particular relation between disjunct sets of objects, what remains when everything else has been removed. This is how we apprehend the so-called **Platonic** Ideals. To question the existence of love is to also question the existence of Number. We therefore conclude this concept and all others must at least share the same type of existence as that given to Number. 

Death is not like this, as it can be neither objectified nor conceptualized. Thus, it can not claim existence through either of these modes of Being. 

### Death-as-not-object

In the first case, Death cannot be objectified through relations, because Death resists at an ontological level the application of the first essential relation in any proposition: that of existence. 

What remains in the statement "_the Being is dead_" when its content is subtracted? The remainder is plainly a contradiction of the law of the excluded middle, i.e. it must be the case that either _A_ or the negation of _A_ is true, where _A_ is understood to be a symbol standing for a proposition upon which a judgement of truth can be rendered. A _Being_ cannot _be_ dead, because to _be_ dead means to _not be_ a _Being_. In claiming that something _is_ Dead, in the present tense, you cannot help but commit a logical fallacy. Death is not something that occurs in anyone's present tense, only in either their future, where it defies the laws of causality to be abstracted into their present, or in the Other's past, where once a Being is dead their Being only exists insofar as it is objectified in the Being of the Other, where it no longer has any subjectivity or consciousness. 

Yet, it makes even less sense to say "_the Being was dead_", for Death as a fact cannot be contradicted by the circumstances of things as they currently are, i.e. if a Being _is_ now, then its Death has not yet occurred and so consequently can not have the operation of "_was_" applied to it. Conversely, if a Being's Death _was_ a fact then, then it must also _be_ a fact now or else the meaning of the operation "_was_" has been violated and we are back to the original problem, having gained no ground. 

There is no way for Death as an object to exist in a logical relationship without a contradiction arising from within its boundaries. 

### Death-as-not-concept

In the second case, Death cannot be conceptualized, except insofar as the Death of the Other makes ingress into the representations of my Being, but then, in this case, it is not _my_ Death that has been conceptualized, but the Death of the Other. The process of conceptualizing Death leaves us with an empty concept, a concept that does not have Being in the way **Platonic Ideals** do, because the abstraction of the Death of the Other leads me no closer to an understanding of my own Death in the way the abstraction of love does lead me to understand what the love of the Other is.

Furthermore, Death as a feeling is like neither love nor duty. The concept of Death induces a feeling, but it is not the feeling of Death that is felt in the way one feels love or duty, for if one felt Death, they would therefore be dead and incapable of feeling. In those instances when one is in the process of apprehending a concept and integrating it into their Being, such as love and its effects, it is a compulsion felt as distinctly as weight or normal force, albeit with a locomotion peculiar to its class. One is compelled to act a certain way because they feel, for lack of a better term, the corporeal sensation of the accompanying conception. 

Death is not a motive concept, in the sense that it induces in the conceiving subject the action denoted by its concept. There is no _phenomonology of Death_, no _qualia of Death_, no Being of Death for the subject, only what **Martin Heidegger** termed `Being-toward-death`. The subject can only orient themselves toward Death, but they can not bring it any closer without thereby ceasing to exist. 

### Language Games

The concept of `Being-toward-death`, this ontological polarity between Being and Death, brings with it a whole host of subjugated concepts that stand in relation to it: grief, horror, acceptance, denial, love, hate, anger, awe, adulation, worship. Indeed, one might be tempted to conclude Death is the fountainhead from which all other emotions spring. The only other analogous concept is to be found in the spiritual; for instance, in the Judeo-Christian concept of the `mysterium tremendum`, whereby the worshipper enters into a state of rapture, by turns jubliant and horrified, when considering the object of his or her worship. Death, in this sense, overlaps with the Holy. 

**Heidegger** liked to play language games. By `Being-toward-death`, he meant to oppose this to his term `Being-in-itself`, in order to draw our attention to the prepositions connecting the objects in the concepts. A thing can be _in_ itself, whereas we can only be _toward_ Death, the relation in these phrases indicating the way Death always recedes away from us. 

In one of the few true positive analogies possible with Death as one of its poles (for reasons that will shortly be discussed), Death in this respect is similar to the concept of a limit from real analysis. The existence of a limit relies on the subtle notion of mathematical Continuity. In our everyday understanding of Continuity, we tacitly assume a logical form whereby a set is ordered and this ordering is such that each term succeeds the previous in a contingent way so that the series becomes "_connected_"; every member in the set becomes the next member through the property of "_continuity_", in an almost mystical, transubstantive process; In travelling from point A to point B in space, one must travel through all intervening points and one does so in a way by which we mean "_continuous_". 

Our everyday intuition of Continuity skips over Zeno's paradox, i.e. the infinitely divisible length, without even considering its annihiliating consequences. As mathematics has discovered, though, this is a fallacy of our intuition. The subject objectifies Being into representative forms and we cannot help but discretize a continuum when abstracting it into our thoughts; it is only through the aid of symbolic logic, as **Bertrand Russell** put it, that we are able to construct the necessary mental apparatus to perceive the true nature of continuity. When we apply rigor to the definition of a limit, we are forced into a definition where we can only say what it means to _approach_ a point, never to _arrive_ at a point. The modern mathematical definition of a limit symbolizes exactly this idea: getting _infinitely_ close to a point without actually _arriving_ at it is logically equivalent to physically passing through the point being approached, so that is suffices to define the latter in terms of the former, i.e. the _delta-epsilon_ definition of a limit. Indeed, pointwise discontinuities are permitted within the theorems of differential and integral calculus. In other words, a curve connecting point A and point B is mathematically the same as another curve connecting point A and point B with a countably infinite number of points removed. The implication here is then that it is possible for something to exist without it having membership in the set of things we call _existence_; or to put it another way, the thing you are approaching need not even exist in order to approach it.

Continuity implies an abundance so excessive that it can, without contradiction, contain an _infinite_ number of Nothings. Within this statement we see a profound truth: our inability to understand the nature of things. This notion of Continuity does not make sense. Indeed, it takes a trained mathematician many years, except in cases of genius, to overcome the intuitions ingrained into our experience through our everyday lives that lead us to form an incorrect understanding of Continuity. 

In this way, we say Death is an ontological limit (perhaps _the_ ontological limit). Death is something that exists by virtue of our perpetual approach towards it, but this does not necessarily mean that Death is an existent thing. In the same way that a limit may approach a value only to find the value missing but nevertheless yield that self-same value, we approach Death. 

In this language game we are playing, we see why, then, it is possible to draw a positive connection between the concept of a limit and the concept of Death, despite Death's aversion to conceptualization. Because the limit attempts to express precisely what Schopenhaur called the `principle of sufficient reason` in space, and because all Being in space is subject to Death, the concept of a limit contains within it a seed of the original horror of Being: that something we perceive as existent when it comes to pass might reveal itself as Nothing at all. There is nothing to be found in the contingency of Being that can guarantee our existence. When we die, we cease to exist and then there is Nothing, or anyway there is a thing functionally equivalent Nothing so that the differences between the two are irrelevant. Moreover, there is no way to escape the gravitation of Nothing; from the moment of Life, the draw is palpable, or as **Heidegger** put it, "_when man is born, he is old enough to die_".

Death, then, is a strange type of concept, a oddity among things. It lacks content, it lacks Being, it cannot be observed, it cannot be felt, it recedes from our perception as we approach it, yet it is an inevitability no living Being can escape. What sort of thing, then, is Death? How do we begin to come to terms with it, if it cannot be understood?

## A Godelian Counterargument

A final argument may be raised against the supposition that Death is unknowable, an argument resulting from the exhaustion of philosophers; when they find the foundation of their logic crumbling beneath them and all other options gone, they retreat to the warm embrace of their one true ally: solipsism, but in this case, a perverse, negative sort of solipsism. 

If by positive solipsism we take to mean the impossibility of knowing whether anything outside ourselves exists or not, then by negative solipsism we mean the impossiblity of knowing until we die that Death is unknowable. To phrase it another way to make the form of the argument more apparent: that Death is unknowable is unknowable until we die. This statement resembles a tautology, i.e. A = A, but upon further reflection, the relation contained in the statement is one of recursion: that in order to know that Death is unknowable, we must first die, but to die we must first relinquish the ability to know in the first place, leaving us at the exact point where we started. The statement refers to its own form. We chase ourselves in circles, each point in our path eventually leading back to itself, never making any forward progress. 

To this argument we must finally concede victory. Despite the great efforts of history's philsophers and scientists, there is no way to ground an the objectification of Being without assuming a subject exists to observe it, and there is no basis for the assumption of a subject. Thus does the contingency of Being evaporate into Nothing. 

This has led many astray into the realm of divine explanation, that something other than what is must provide the basis for what is, because clearly it is the case that things are. If their contingency cannot ultimately be found in ourselves, then it must be found _somewhere_ we reason. In this same way, **Schopenhauer** ultimately violated his own `principle of sufficient reason` by positing something beyond what is, i.e. the Will, to explain what he himself said could only be explained via sufficiency and necessity. 




## Existence by Contradiction

The great workhorse of mathematics is proof by contradiction. An assumption is made, an absurdity is shown to result from the assumption, therefore the assumption is shown to be false. In this way was modern mathematics constructed, by outlining the truth and demarcating its boundary with falsity. Anyone who has studied higher mathematics will attest to the way most mathematical proofs work by letting the truth in through the back door (to borrow a phrase from Schopenhauer), that is to say, they work by showing what cannot be the case in order to prove the opposite must be so. But this does not reveal the "_essence_" of the theorem to the observer; indeed one can comprehend a proof without understanding anything about what it trying to say and in the converse direction, one may understand a concept without being able to grasp its proof in the slightest; so it is with induction: a proof of induction relies on a contradiction that an element belongs to two mutually exclusive sets, which we are forced to admit is absurdity, therefore we conclude induction must be true; but nowhere in the proof do we see why the form in an induced series is transmitted from one term to the next. Likewise, a student can spend an entire academic career studying the axioms and theorems of real analysis and still have no intuition for how a falling stone's trajectory traces a parabola with respect to time, despite having memorized a series of proofs that show how to go from set theory to differential calculus.

This, however, is a logical method well-suited for Death, since as we have noted, Death will never be understood. The only course we may avail ourselves of is to define what Death is not and trace its outline through the ink of negation. Indeed, this has been the course of the present work. We shall continue that course of negating our way towards an understanding of Death, an understanding that we have already noted in detail is impossible. _C'est la vie_.

Death can not be the reason for the something, because it is Nothing at all, it is the distinct and inexplicable lack of Being where there should be one. Death cannot be given as motive to explain an action because Death implies the impossiblity of action. Death will not fit into the operations of modus ponens or syllogism, because there can never be any intuitive jump from a hypothesis that presupposes nonexistence. The mind is incapable of understanding the logic of Death. We have in Death a Kantian `nihil negativum`, a Nothingness born from absurdity, a nullity by necessity, a concept without content or form. 

No matter the starting point, Death is always like this, impenetrable to typical modes of analysis. Death is not the cause of anything, except insofar that is objectified in the perception of another. But upon making ingress into the Other's perception, it is no longer a subjective experience, but a fact among others. In this sense, Death is similar to consciousness, in that consciousness once objectified in the consciousness of another ceases to be consciousness at all, but becomes a representation of that consciousness, an indication pointing beyond the realm of my Being towards the Being of another, unknowable like Death, but unlike Death, inferrable through the observance of the causal connections that unite us in our Being. In other words, the Other is unknowable as an experience, but the experience of the Other as object is knowable through the medium of representation. We can recognize intelligence in the world outside of ourselves through the arrangement of forms. In this way, I know whatever entity responsible for traffic signs is also an intelligent being because traffic signs indicate a concept we both understand, and this understanding is embodied through the course of our synchronized action, and through this understanding and sychronization we come to know each other. 

## Sartre

The concept of Death as an objective fact within a complex of knowledge, however, refers to something that does not exist. It is a negative fact, an indication without source. In this sense, Death is similar to Sartre's `Being-for-Itself`, in that the essence of Death is a type of Being that can never be what it is, but can only be in the mode of not Being, a type of Nothingness. Sartre, like Schopenhaur, Heidegger and Kant, was an existentialist, and like those prior existentialists, he too liked to play language games. He thought the essential human nature was one of contradiction, that we cannot understand ourselves except in terms the logic of absurdity, so his ontology is littered with contradictions that seek to capture the essential human nature.

During a lecture on symbolic logic, Russell was explaining the notion that anything and everything can be proved from a false premise. A student in the back of the class raised his hand and ask him to prove he was the pope if 1 = 2. Without missing a beat, Russell replied, "The pope and I form a set of two. But 2 = 1, therefore I am the pope". In this way, the geometry of the possibile becomes infinite in extent when contradiction forms its basis; this is what Sartre meant when he said `Being-for-itself` was "_condemned to be free_"; that is to say, the so-called `Dasein`, our experience of _Being there_, cannot help but exist in a world of uncountable possibility because its whole Being rests on a contradiction, that we can never be what we are, that is `Being-in-itself`, an entity totally contained in its representation.

The great project of pre-modern philosophy was the enumeration of the laws of Being. From Plato on up to Kant and ending sometime around Whitehead and Sartre, successive ontologies were constructed around the abstraction of Being and its mechanics into conceptual frameworks whereby "_theorems_" about the nature of Being could be deduced, or at least stated in a semi-rigorous language so the philosophical question could be understood with more granularity. 

There is however a glaring omission in each ontologies hitherto proposed as a framework for understanding Being. Only tangentially do these frameworks discuss and examine Death. Death is not baked into their foundation; it was only until the attempts of Camus, Bataille and Derrida that we have our first philosophical forays in the realm of the truly unknowable, and with them their approach was more aesthetic than it was analytical. There is a reason for this: all the crystalline perfection of a systematic dissertation of Being is undone by the concept of Death. If an ontological system is held up to the light of Death, it immediately evaporates into sophistry. 

## Schopenhauer

As an example, Schopenhauer states the world exists for the subject, all time and space is merely the phenomenal intepretation of the `thing-in-itself`. In the absence of the subject, there is no time or space with which to apprehend Being, there is no form to be perceived, because the object presupposes the subject. In order to prevent this absurdity, he introduces `Will` as that which remains when the form of Being has been subtracted, i.e. the residue of Being when its appearance is dispersed. Time and space are contingent on `Will` objectifying existence and thus bringing the subject-object dyad into Being. 

Throughout history, when confronted with the impossibile, philosophers have invented a myriad of terms meant to somehow conceptualize it and thus circumvent it its presence in their frameworks. For Schopenhaur it was `Will`, for Whithead it was `Process`, for the spiritual, it is the `soul`. The notion their frameworks for understanding Being might be poison from the start is something the mind rejects out of hand, for the mind can only apprehend things which are possible. So the dialectic continues, forever until the end of time, the human will repeatedly deny his or her existence is not Nothing and is thereby something, and in the process, he or she will bring into existence entire conceptual frameworks meant to prove it so. 

What Schopenhauer did not consider, perhaps because thermodynamics was still in infancy and its second law had only been crudely stated by the time he published _The World as Will and Representation_, is what happens when everything is dead, for that is inevitable end of all things in an entropic universe. The optimist's hope that procreation will sustain life indefinitely is absurd; even if life were somehow shifted into the digital realm and silicone were imbued with consciousness, the possibility of death cannot be removed; it lurks in the quantum uncertainty, in the random fluctations that might thereby disorder whatever form conscioussness has assumed; it resides in the catacylsmic, in the afterbirth of violent supernova, in the vast emptiness of space where nothing can be found for literal eternities; it exists in the mundane, in graduations of a thermometer, in the crumbling edges of cliffs, in the unlucky moments when the universe contorts itself into a blade and strikes. Forever is our Being inextricably linked with its own end; and when the sum of all such Beings is taken in total, there can be no denying there will come point when the last subject in Schopenhauer's dyad has perished. And what happens at that point? Does the world cease to exist? And if that is the case, at the point when only Nothing remains, in what sense can we say anything ever really existed? There will be no proof to which to point, no observer to lay claim to the world. Everything that ever was will be as a dream, except even a dream is recalled however briefly upon waking. When everyone is dead, there will be no one to wake.

There is in this problem illuminated the meaning of solipism, to which no satisfactory answer can ever be given. My Being is just so that it can never know if it truly exists. Any ontology must necessarily become solipism at the point in which the subject enters into it. 

## Wittenstein

Wittgenstein used the following diagram to illustrate this nebulousness of conceptualization.

![]()

We have here an interesting representation of _something_. It hard to pin down what _exactly_ it is, though. It is at once a rabbit and a duck, but neither concept fully emerges in the mind until a point of view is selected. Once the point is selected and the concept brought forth, the other concept evaporates entirely from the perception. In order to perceive the hidden concept, the perception of the other must likewise evaporate. It is only with great effort that we are able to hold both concepts in mind simultaneously, and furthermore this requires a letting go, i.e. the reconceptualization of the image into a unity of something like a rabbit-duck, a new existent thing; Schopenhauer would say the `Will` has thus objectified a "_lower grade_" phenomenon into a higher order `thing-in-itself`; This is what Schopenhauer meant by the `objectification of will`, or the `graduations of will`. Whitehead would say an `actual entity` has been `concretized`, and refer to the totality as a `Process`.

If we do not admit to Schopenhauer's postulate, namely that once representation is removed the remainder is `Will`, how far can we go in understanding our representation of this image? What assumptions are necessary and sufficient in order to understand our inability to see both images in this picture at once without thereby assimilating them into something new? 

In order to avoid the addition of superfluous terms like `Will` or `Soul` that must ultimately be given in addition to what is necessary and sufficient, we shall say: our perception of an object cannot exist without a concept to ground it. 

This does not afford much leeway in which to make deductions about the nature of conception. With this definition, we are forced into the position the image has no definite concept to encompass it all at once. And this is exactly what Wittgenstein meant to show: that perception and conceptualization are not definite things, but instead are fuzzy, like overlapping circles, where a point can claim to be in multiple circles at once. It is only when a single circle is drawn into the attention that we see the point in relation to it alone, but this does not contradict its membership in other circles. 

It is strange to the human to say the image is both things at once and neither at the same time. We are repulsed from this conclusion in the same way we do not admit an object can be in two positions at once without thereby becoming separate objects; space is nothing more than the relationship of objects to one another, and to claim this relationship might be something other than what it is defies our ability to understand. But Kant has already shown this as nothing more than our inability to know the `noumena`, the existent thing. What is flawed is our phenomenal apprehension, that we are confined to the thing's representation in time and space; the thing remains, but our perception cannot, as it were, get a grip on it. It can not hold it firmly in a single logical proposition.





Death, in its inestimatible way, has yet another unique property. For it is always with us in the form of possibility. This is not like other possibilities, which only emerge when we comport ourselves in a specific way. In other words, a thing is possible insofar that we understand how it may come to be, given where, when and how we are at this current moment in time. For this reason, we can understand propositions such as "the human had five eyes" or "the car drank a quart of whiskey" in terms of their possible explanation with respect to Being as hypotheticals that may manifest under the right circumstances, like a chemical compound that only forms its crystalline structure within a restricted range of temperature and pressure, whereas propositions such as "the distance is blue" or "five is salty" can only assume possibilities if we admit different interpretations of their respective forms. In this way, we say possibilitiy is contingent on Being. 

Any action we take depends on our relationship to the world, and therefore all possibility is possibility only insofar that it bears a relation to the world; we have the possibility of apprehension and understanding because our Being in space is composed of location and orientation and the relative arrangements of the representative forms of our perception; we have the possibility of movement because our Being in time is composed of change, i.e. the transformation of spatial relations across a dimension irreducible to space. Possibility is the enumeration of all trajectories in possibility-space emanating from a point, where the axes decompose into the modes of our Being, i.e. causality, time and space. 

**Schopenhauer** correctly argued that space and time are nothing more than the representative form assumed by our perception of Being. They condition the possibilities of Being. They are, in a sense, the substance of possibility. 

There is, however, one possibility that does not obey this rule. 

Death is the only possibility that has no contingency on Being, on so-called `facticity`, in the same way we say a horizontal line has no dependence on the value of the x-axis; it haunts every moment, throughout eternity, irrespective of where, how or when we find ourselves. 




Indeed, Death is always with us but we do not apprehend it in our Being until we first see its outline in the absence of another's Being, i.e. the Death of the Other. As children, we do not understand Death until we first understand the Other, that outside of ourselves are others like us, unknowable yet inferrable. Knowledge of death then follows when we finally confront it in the end of the Other.
