# Death

## The Stage 

If the author is granted one contribution to the annals of philosophy, let it be the proof of the futility of all future philosophies. 

In constructing such a proof, we shall adhere to the grand tradition of philosophy and arbitrarily capitalize these concepts to denote their precise meaning in the following discourse: _Being_, _Father_, _Life_, _Mother_, _Nothing_, _Other_ and _Death_. We do this for no other reason but because, in inimitable the words of 20th century's greatest philsopher **Bill Waterson**, we "_must obey the inscrutable exhortions of (our) soul_".

## The Question

**Albert Camus** once stated there is but one philosophical question and that is suicide. In this, **Camus** skipped over much to arrive at his starting point. However, to his credit, he only meant it in the rhetorical sense, as way to examine the absurdity of living in a universe where you are fated from the very start to die at the end. Nevertheless, there is a definite proximity to truth in his formulation of the so-called "_philosophical question_". 

Death is the bedrock at the bottom of Being. As such, we are condemned to die simply by Being. Whether we die in ignorance or with full awareness of our mortality matters not to Death, because Death is not something that _cares_[^1]. From this and because of this, all things proceed. 

A Being cannot _be_ without the phantom of Death haunting its every step through time. Only in the sequel, once reflective consciousness[^2] enters into the equation, do we ask whether or not a life always imperilled is worth living.

Despite being the foundation of almost every human pathology, Death as a field of inquiry has received comparatively little analysis over the course of history, except in the medical sciences where it is treated clinically, i.e. as a `thing-in-itself`, to be catalogued and diagnosed along with all the other maladies and diseases and thus placed into a knowable relation with the rest of existence, or in the spiritual studies, where it is mythologized and understood only through metaphor, never as an experience that happens _to_ us. Rare are the personalities like **Nietzsche**, **Bataille** or **Cioran**, who confront Death as it is, without the window dressing of ideology or assumption.

There is a reason for this. Death as a subject is repellant to understanding. Its very definition presupposes the limit of the knower; That is to say, Death is inherently unknowable. Death can only be understood through the mechanisms of analogy and metaphor, for when we turn our attention directly to the object of Death it reveals itself as something which can not be found in Being. 

We can be aware that we will eventually die, we can perceive others passing from this world of existence, we can even in unique circumstances perceive the manner of our own Death, but that awareness will never be extended into Death itself. Death is the point where awareness stops, if by "_awareness_" we mean `Being-in-the-world`. 

In this way, we mean Death exists beyond the limit of understanding; to make relationship thus denoted more clear, we might coin the term `understanding-of-the-world`[^3], and posit Death as that which removes this from Being, and thus annihiliates Being. We see, as a result of the unknowability of Death, how the ontological necessity between Being and knowledge emerges. Death, in its unknowability, illuminates. 

Death then, while unapproachable, becomes a way to understand our own Being, for it shows us the domain of the problem, the problem being what it means _to be_. Death is `a priori` to Being, baked into the all ontologies, even if they do not explicitly acknowledge it as such. _To be_ inherently contains the possibility of _not Being_. The `invariance` of Death is a fundamental constant of nature and thus provides the metric by which to unpack existence into representative form. 

To ask questions about a subject that perpetually recedes from all attempts to know it necessarily entails the admission up front that no answers can ever be conceived, much less perceived. The inevitable end result will be to arrive where we started, having gained Nothing, except perhaps understanding, which will anyway evaporate when we die; If any proposition can lay claim to human nature, this is it. 

It would seem, then, it does not matter which direction we choose to go, since we will always return to our starting point, no better or worse for having made the circuit. For this reason, the author recommends no one should read what follows. Instead, the reader is advised that going outside is by far a better course of action.

[^1]: As if often the case when playing the exisentialist language game, we adopt the **Heideggerian** sense of the word _care_, or _concern_, i.e. the way in which a conscious Being orients itself in the world, or the manner in which we are drawn into the world, so that we might engage with it. 

[^2]: `reflective consciousness` as opposed to `ontical consciousness`; i.e. the consciousness of being conscious versus being conscious. This is what **Heidegger** called the split between _ontology_ and _onticity_. The human, or more generally, the `Dasein`, is a type of Being which is capable of reflecting on its Being. 

[^3]: We add here the caveat the terminology so far introduced is yet a complete and exhaustive description of the ontological relations being examined. Throughout the course of the present, we will attempt to elucidate what it means _to be_ in relation to Death; this neologism is the first many we will formulate, as the primary function of philosophy seems to be the production of esoteric phrases. 

### Existence by Contradiction

With the warnings of futility thus dispensed, we proceed as many have proceeded before us.

The great workhorse of mathematics is proof by contradiction. An assumption is made, an absurdity is shown to result from the assumption, therefore the assumption is shown to be false. In this way was modern mathematics constructed, by outlining the truth and demarcating its boundary with falsity. Anyone who has studied higher mathematics will attest to the way most mathematical proofs work by letting the truth "_in through the back door_"[^4], that is to say, they work by showing what cannot be the case in order to prove the opposite must be so, but this gets us no closer to _why_ it is so.

This method does not reveal the "_intuition_" of the theorem to the observer; indeed one can comprehend a proof without understanding anything about what it trying to say and in the converse direction, one may understand a concept without being able to grasp its proof in the slightest.

So it is with induction: a proof of induction, and therefore a proof _by_ induction, relies on a contradiction that an element belongs to two mutually exclusive sets, which we are forced to admit is absurdity, therefore we conclude induction must be true; but nowhere in the proof do we see why the form in an induced series is transmitted from one term to the next. Likewise, a student can spend an entire academic career studying the axioms and theorems of real analysis and still have no intuition for how a falling stone's trajectory traces a parabola with respect to time, despite having memorized a series of proofs that show how to go from set theory to differential calculus.

This, however, is a logical method well-suited for Death, since as we have noted, Death will never be understood. The only course we may avail ourselves of is to define what Death is not and trace its outline through the ink of negation. Indeed, this will be the course of the present work. We shall attempt to negate our way towards an understanding of Death, an understanding that we have already noted is impossible. _C'est la vie_.

### Death by Deduction

A close correlate of _understanding_ is _reason_.

Death can not be the reason for anything in our _phenomenal_ life, because it is Nothing at all in the first place; Death is the distinct and inexplicable lack of Being where there should be one. Death cannot be given as motive to explain an action because Death implies the impossiblity of action. If Death has a logic, an algebra of its own by which we pass from one equivalent form of Death to the next, it is not one the mind can grasp; Death has no form to manipulate, no symbology to short-circuit, no appearance to transform. Death is that which we cannot get to through representation.

Death will not fit into the grooves of logic, into the operations of modus ponens or syllogism, because there can never be any intuitive jump from a hypothesis that presupposes nonexistence (<sup><sub>[a topic to which we will return in later sections](#death-as-not-object)</sub></sup>). We have in Death a Kantian `nihil negativum`, a Nothingness born from absurdity, a nullity by necessity, a concept without content or form. 

Death cannot be tested as a hypothesis, because Death is not the cause of anything; Death is the end result. What happens thereafter cannot be communicated back through the mechanisms of causality to Beings still alive. Death is the ultimate datum to which all hypotheses must point but never reveal. Because of this, our endeavor is doomed from the start arrive at Nothing. 

Analysis can only claim validity to extent that it can be brought into correspondence with the objects it purports to analyze. Any analysis of Death must eventually come to the point where it is held up against the Nothingness it represents and finds a lacking therein, not in itself, for lacking is not in the contingency of form, but in what the form attempts to represent, the absence of Being, the hole where Nothing now remains. Thus fails the project of analysis in itself entirety. 

Regardless, perhaps in spite of this, we proceed. In order to make these features of Death emerge from the discourse, we will attempt to create an ontology of Death. In the first pass, we will extract from the philosophers and scientists who preceded us whatever we find useful and salient, and then append to this piecemeal framework the following: 
    
1. `axiom of precluded existence`: Death exists for all Beings.
2. `axiom of failed contingency`: Death is unknowable through phenomena (<sup><sub>_appearance_</sub></sup>). 
3. `axiom of non-equivalence`: Unknowability is phenomenally (<sup><sub>_apparently_</sub></sup>) equivalent to Nothing.

With the first axiom, it is likely we all agree or are at least willing to grant truth long enough to see what follows. We then turn to the justification of the latter two axioms, as the meaning of either the `axiom of failed contingency` or the `axiom of non-equivalence` is not clear at first glance. 

## A Kantian Counterargument

In true negative fashion, we will start by asssuming what is false and show how it leads to a contradiction. The negation of the `axiom of failed contingency` is that Death _is_ knowable through phenomena. With this in hand, the counterargument to the `axiom of failed contingency` can be raised along the following lines.

A rock sits before us. It is self-evident that what we find in our apprehension of the rock is not the rock in itself, but our representation of the rock. As **Immanual Kant** demonstrated and **Arthur Schopenhauer** refined, all knowledge is only knowledge of our representation of world, its reflection in the sense data, the enumeration of objects through the medium of form (<sup><sub>i.e., `objectification`</sup></sub>). We do not know the world as it is; we only know the world as it appears. This is the distinction between `noumena`, the _existent_, and the `phenomena`, the _appearance_, that **Kant** famously discovered, or at least put to paper before anyone else. 

The interiority of a rock, its _existence_, is by definition beyond the limits of our Being, as we can only ever apprehend its appearance, but we do not thus claim a rock cannot be understood or that the rock is unknowable, or else mechanics would be of no practical use. 

We come to an understanding of mechanics and physics through our representations. We approach the rock, experience how its appearance depends on our perspective, on our ability to relate to it through space and time. We interact with it and thereby come to an understanding of its nature. We discover its boundaries, the surface across which it begins and we end. We can _feel_ its existence when we pick it up, along the lines of force that oppose our own and pull it back towards it gravitational focus. When we push on the rock, it pushes back and impinges on our senses. Its inertia becomes tangible in our grasp. 

In other words, we find ourselves _in_ the world _with_ the rock, what **Heidegger** termed `throwness`. It is only in the sense that we cannot _be_ the rock, that it is separate from us; there is imposed between us a `nihil privativum`, a void between the representation of our Being and our Being itself. 

If we admit to the existence of knowledge and knowability in general, then we also admit to the assumption that which is not our Being can come to be known through our Being. To say Death is unknowable is tantamount to claiming anything external to our Being lacks existence, goes the counterargument to the `axiom of failed contingency`. The fallacy of the proposed counterargument lies in tacit assumption the void crossed from existence to appearance is equivalent to the void crossed between Being and Death. 

However, Death cannot be found in the regurgitations of existence into appearance. No matter where we turn, our own Deaths are nowhere to be found in the appearances we attach to the world. Death has no boundaries that we perceive. We cannot approach it in space. Death cannot be probed. It has no weight to be felt, no surface to touch. There is no way to know what is on the other side of it, or even if there is another side, for Death has no reflection in sensation, or at the very least this sensation is commensurate with the cessation of sensation in a way that will always remain inaccessible to us. Once Death is apprehended and integrated into our Being, we cease to be Beings. 

If Death has its own interiority, i.e. a Being of Death for us, there is no mechanism to be found in the totality of existence for measuring it or bringing it into our apprehension. For as **Wittgenstein** once said, "_the picture cannot place itself outside of its form of representation_" [^5].

### The Death of the Definition

It may be argued the definition of Death adopted in the preceding is too narrow, that is seeks to restrict itself to the personal, to the experiential, to the phenomenal and in doing so fails to acknowledge the objective and communal aspect of Death, that is to say, the definition of Death as it has been discussed so far does not include our apprehension of the Death of the Other.

To this point, we counter immediately with three counterpoints: 

1. If, in the analysis of Death, we are not seeking a phenomology of Death, a personal experience of Death, then what is it we are seeking? What do we hope to achieve?

2. How do we bring to our attention the implicit ontological relation that binds us to the non-Being of Death versus the non-Being of pre-existence, i.e. Death vs. Prebirth, without narrowing the scope of Death to indicate exactly that one type of non-Being and not the other?

3. What is lacking in our current definition of Death that would broaden its scope to include the category of phenomenon here termed _the Death of the Other_?

Let us in turn dwell on each question and see where it leads, if anywhere at all, which does not seem likely given the strange dialectic so far traversed. 

### Phenomenology of Death

To the first point: If the assumption of the general unknowability of Death is granted, this would seem necessarily to lead to the exclusion of the possibilty of a _phenomonology of Death_. How can we bring into Being and experience that which cannot be known? Indeed, if death is unknowable, how do we know it hasn't already occurred? This is the purest form of `solipsism`: that we ourselves as Beings have no way of knowing if we have already died.[^6]

Following this solipsistic train of thought to its destination, we must reason there is no basis for assuming Being should be any different than Nothing, for we cannot get to the other side of Nothing in order to check. It follows we therefore have no basis for saying: if Death is Nothing (<sup><sub>in the _phenomenl_ sense</sub></sup>), then Death should preclude Being. The conclusion we then draw is Being is not necessarily mutually exclusive with Death. What resides in this strange overlap of Being and Death, if not the _phenomenology of Death_? The problem `solipsism` wished to disperse emerges from the dust, like the eternal phoenix [^7]

We shall return to the [topic of unknowability](#a-godelian-counterargument) later on and discuss it in more detail. We must remark, at this point, however, that unknowability is like a disease, passing from host to host, rendering all that it touches weak and unable to withstand the force of inspection. The analogy of disease falters, however, for there exists no disease which infects itself. 

_Unknowability_ as a relation when applied to _unknowability_ as an object yields back to us the existence of possibilty[^8]. In other words, "_if you tried to doubt everything you would not get as far as doubting anything. The game of doubting itself presupposes certainty_"[^9]. If a thing is unknowable, then there exists a recursion of knowability that attaches itself through necessity to the nodes of unknowability, because one cannot approach _unknowability_ without thereby coming to know _of_ it. In this way, we form the chain of propositions:

- Death is unknowable.
- "_Death is unknowable_" is knowable

We see in this argument how how the tendrils of knowability intersect with those of unknowability, and give us at least a foothold to raise our awareness towards Death. If Death is unknowable, then we can at least come to know what it means to be unknowable and thus gain an understanding of Death through analogy. This is all we can possibly mean by _phenomology of Death_ in any ontology that seeks to avoid the pitfalls of `solipsism`: that we can come to know what is unknowable, i.e. Death, "_through the back door_". 

[^6]: Is saying "_we have no way of knowing if we are already dead_" the same as saying "_we have no way of knowing if we exist_"?
[^7]: We should, at this point, lift our eyes from the page and let our gaze fall upon the world. In our deepest moments of reflection, when all pretenses are abandoned and we consider the `invariance` of the **Cartesian** tautology, "_I do not know if I exist_", the complexity of uncertainty manifested in the vastness of the world rises as if in response. The answer is self-evident, "_if I do not exist, then what is this?_", i.e. we have simply played semantics and shifted the meaning of existence and Being away from language, instead of letting language take hold and illuminate. In other words, a true solipsist would read the written word without gaining consciousness of what was expressed therein and continue on as if nothing had happened. The solipsist is he who refuses to play the _language game_, and therefore the _existence game_, for all existence is mere appearance to me, and all appearance is mere representation, and all representation is _mere_ language. 
[^8]: The phrase "_existence of possibility_" is equivalent to the phrase "_possibility of possibility_", which brings to the attention the reflexive and tautological relation between _existence_ and _possbility_.

### Non-Being

TODO

### Other-as-Life

We now turn to two of the most important sections in establishing the proposed axioms of Death, this section and the next in which we explore the relation of our Being to that of the Other, and the relation of each of these plus their conjunction to that of Death.[^10]

We start with a question that will at first glance appear to provide the entrypoint for the contradiction of the `axiom of failed contingency`: How do we know we die?

To make the intent of the question more plain, let us recast it: Would a human raised in isolation comprehend its own mortality?[^11]

We said before Death is the final fact towards which all ontologies, all ways of Being, must ultimately comport. We will now show how this arises through Being's apprehension of its `facticity`. The thought experiment of a human reared in isolation brings this into relief. We thus further clarify our assumptions first to avoid any ambiguities in the arguments that follow. 

Let us assume the human is in an all white room (<sup><sub>to better evoke _eternity_</sub></sup>) and this is the extent of the space[^12] alloted to it throughout the course of its existence[^13]. We immediately ask ourselves how it is the human is sustained in this thought experiment. This question begets another, more fundamental question: whether the first question, that of sustenance, is a question of ontology or biology. Is Being `contingent` on biology or is biology `contigent` on Being? Is it possible _to be_ without first being a "_biological Being_"? 

**Heidegger**' would say that any philosophy that calls itself such is properly concerned with the nature of Being that precedes the Being of biology, i.e. the _ontology_ of Being versus the _onticity_ of Being. Here we meet a problem elucidated by **Eugene Thacker** in _After Life_: the ontology of Being appears at odds with the ontology of Life, for in order exorcise biology from Being, we must first account for the possibility of Life in its ontology. In other words, to pose this proposition as a question: is our _Life_ as a Being the same as our Being as a _biological Life_?

The advance of technology seems to point towards a point where consciousness will enter the digital realm. By entertaining this possibility, we are forced into a position where we must provide an ontological basis for a Life that is not biological, that is at once also separate from the ontology of Being. If it is the case that one day awareness will emerge via the electronic, what sort of _contingency_ would such as Being have? 

Claim: the infant does not act in the mode of assauging desires, it acts in the mode of desire itself. It does not _want_ to consume, it merely consumes when the appropriate stimuli emerge from its apprehension of the world. Through this the infant learns the `law of causality`, i.e. how it relates to its Being and how its action or inaction causes the world to respond or not respond.

In the absence of the _Other_, the infant would die, its pure desire unable to reflect on how to overcome itself. The infant would perceive only raw desire and a unreactive world. In this state, we lack the conditions for consciousness. Consciousness cannot arise and come to know the world as something with which it can interact if the world does not in the first place rise to meet its presence. In that case, the Being that would be consciousness merely dies, existing as only a brief moment of unfilled desire, a flash of Being in the eternity of Nothing.

Biology is only incidental to this picture. It is the form through which Death rips away Being.

Our Being is a Being of knowledge, among other things. Knowledge is the coincidence of form. By form, we do not mean _matter_, or _atoms_, or _particles_. We mean the way Being is composed of _indications_ towards something which it is not, _existence_. Knowledge is `factical`, in the sense that it requires time and space as the horizon by which to express it. As infants moments from our birth, there are only the beginnings of knowledge, the first points in our _world trajectory_ which we will use as reference for the relations that form the "_nexus_" of our Being.

Knowledge of nourishment requires knowledge of ourselves as humans. We cannot have knowledge of our Being human without the representative form of the Other against which to compare and contrast our own Being. We are only human insofar there are Other humans. In the case where there are no humans, the label of human no longer references to an appearance in our phemonology, unless we take it to mean _myself_. In an ontology of one, the term human becomes equivalent to _myself_, and thus loses all meaning.

What is it that initiialy draws us to the Mother's breast? Do we possess an instinct for it? The modern substitution of the bottle for the nipple seems to give lie to this claim. If there is no instinct to consume, then the most we can say it we come to know what it means to consume. How else would this knowledge come to our Being, except through our recognition of the Other's representative form as it relates to our desires? 

Is the distinction of Mother versus Father ontological? 

[^10]: This section will necessarily involve a good deal of inquiry, as it involves questions relating to appearance of Beings outside ourselves, a tenuous area we must be careful to analyze with `care`. We therefore will assault the reader with many questions. With each _"?"_, the author would humbly request the reader to pause and contemplate the meaning of what preceded it before continuing. 
[^11]: In what follows, we abandon the halls of solipsism for a moment, to make further progress in the event its negation is ever shown to be the case. 
[^12]: We do not say `world` here, in anticipation of the conclusions to follow. We will see again that `world` and `space` are not synomnous, as we have remarked tangentially in the preceding discussions of **Schopenhauer**.
[^13]: "_throughout the course of its existence_" What does this mean if not "_until it dies_"? Has Death covertly entered into the dialectic, even at this early stage?

### Other-as-Death

Upon making ingress into the Other's perception, Death is no longer a subjective experience, but instead a fact among others. In this sense, Death is similar to consciousness, in that consciousness once objectified in the consciousness of another ceases to be consciousness at all, but becomes a representation of that consciousness, an indication pointing beyond the realm of Being towards the Being of another, unknowable like Death, but unlike Death, inferrable through the observance of the causal connections that unite us in our Being. 

In other words, the Other is unknowable as an experience, but the experience of the Other as an objectified ingression into the sense data is knowable through the medium of representation. Put more simply, we can recognize intelligence in the world outside of ourselves through the presence of form. In this way, I know whatever entity responsible for traffic signs is also an intelligent being because traffic signs indicate a concept we both understand, and this understanding is embodied through the course of our synchronized action, and through this understanding and sychronization we come to know the point of emanation in our world of action not our own as the Other. 

## A Platonic Counterargument

A further counterargument may be made by the **Platonists**: If Death cannot be approached or felt, this does not signify a rupture in Being, a fundamental horror woven into the fabric of existence, for this is also the nature of concepts. Ephemeral ideas like honor and duty cannot be approached. You cannot probe the interiority of love. These things nonetheless exist, not concretely as in the case of physical matter, i.e. as objects, but abstractly, through the reflection of consciousness, i.e. as concepts. They become existent in our Being despite their lack of "_substance_", as it were, first as awareness through the objectification of the sense data and then as consciousness through the classification of the represented objects into concepts. 

This is the nature of conception, what Heidegger called `readiness-to-hand` and Schopenhauer the `principle of sufficient reason`: a concept exists in relation to the complex it is conceptualizing and its Being for us is exactly this relation abstracted into pure form. So we see a pencil poised over a sheet of paper and immediately apprehend the concept of writing in the relation that joins the tip of the pencil to surface of the paper. This is not the only interpretation of the relation between the two objects here, for conceptualization and the branching relations that form its basis are not a definite process but perpetually efferverscent. However, we will defer discussion of this point until [later](#indetermination), where it is not so out of place.

Instead, the reader's attention is drawn only to the fact in the preceding that a concept exists in a logical form where it refers to a set of representations of our Being and explains some aspect of the relation that defines the class of objects thus being enumerated. The thing which all instances have in common is the concept.

To make the existence of abstraction more apparent, we consider a concept whose existence is not up for the debate, or is at least tacitly assumed by all to have some passing claim to existence. In the same way **Platonic** Ideals are perceived, the concept of Number is never directly observed, only its manifestations. The concept of Number is an abstraction over a disjunction in existence, a union of partitions otherwise separate: The concept of two occurs in the complex of a bicycle as well it does in that of human eyes or sexual reproduction or the electrons in a helium atom, disparate phenomena that share only one commonality. If we substract the differences from these particular manifestations so that we are only left with what they have in common, the residue is exactly Number. 

By way of analogy, love is what remains when the bride and groom have been negated, when the content of the world has been removed and all that is left is the bare relation, its intentional form. A concept is the meaning of a particular class of forms; A concept is the abstraction of a particular relation between disjunct sets of objects, what remains when everything else has been removed. This is how we apprehend the so-called **Platonic** Ideals. To question the existence of love is to also question the existence of Number. We therefore conclude this concept and all others must at least share the same type of existence as that given to Number. 

Death is not like this, as it can be neither objectified nor conceptualized. Thus, it can not claim existence through either of these modes of Being. We will elaborate upon these two ideas in the following sections. 

### Death-as-not-Object

In the first case, Death cannot be objectified through relations, because Death resists at an ontological level the application of the first essential relation in any proposition: that of existence. 

What form remains in the statement "_the Being is dead_" when its content is subtracted? [^10]

The remainder is plainly a contradiction of the `law of the excluded middle`, i.e. it must be the case that either _A_ or the negation of _A_ is true, where _A_ is understood to be a symbol standing for a proposition upon which a judgement of truth can be rendered. A _Being_ cannot _be_ dead, because to _be_ means to _not be_ dead. In claiming that something _is_ dead, in the present tense, you cannot help but commit a logical fallacy. 

Death is not something that occurs in _my_ present, only in either _my_ future, where it defies the laws of causality to be shifted into the present except through the process of time which leads us back to the original statement's contradiction in the present tense, or in the Other's past, where once I am dead my Being only exists insofar as it is objectified in the Being of the Other, where it no longer has any subjectivity or consciousness and can no longer claim to be _my_ Being.

Yet, it makes even less sense to say "_the Being was dead_", for Death as a fact cannot be contradicted by the circumstances of things as they currently are, i.e. the `facticity` of Being. If a Being _is_ now, then its Death has not yet occurred and so consequently can not have the operation of "_was_" applied to it. Conversely, if a Being's Death _was_ a fact previously, then it must also _be_ a fact now or else the meaning of the operation "_was_" has been violated and we are back to the original problem, having gained no ground. 

Indeed, the only way to attach meaning to the preceding proposition is to conjugate it with respect to the future, i.e. "_the Being will be dead_". However, it must be noted, this is a type of future that only exists in the limit, where infinities and infinitesimals yield values that need not exist at any particular moment in time (<sub><sup>see [Language Games](#language-games) for more discussion on the relationship of limits to Death </sub></sup>). In other words, it is a future that never becomes present, but is nonetheless always there, just out of reach. As if logic were on a treadmill, perpetually running in place, never getting anywhere. 

There is no way for Death as an object to exist in a logical relationship without a contradiction arising from within its boundaries, and thus no way to talk about Death without talking in circles. Thus, we have here a glimpse into the essential nature of Death: that which cannot be represented, that which is hidden from representation, that which is hidden from Being, that which can only be Nothing, the `nihil negativum`, a void born from the contingency of the absurd. 

To sum up the ontological relation described in the precedeing paragraphs, with the foregoing warning in mind, we might define Death's relation to our Being with the appropriate **Kantian**-**Heideggerian** neologisms: `Being-before-Death`, `Being-near-Death`, `Being-as-not-Death`. 

If we now toy with the likely hypothesis that Death is a form of ontological negation, we may wonder why negation is only apparent in one of proposed relations. Upon reflection, it should be clear these two, `Being-before-Death` and `Being-near-Death`, are relations whose form is time and space, therefore their relation is one of subjectivity, whereas the last is the subjective relation itself, that is to say, how Death stands in relation our Being itself, i.e. as its negation. As such, we may rephrase to draw out a negation from the subjective relations embodied in the first two concepts, but the last term must necessarily contain a negative.

In other words, we may redefine the first two relations as `Being-not-present-with-Death` and `Being-not-far-from-Death`, respectively. In doing so, we will have gained nothing, except to make apparent the subjective nature of time and space. But the last term, `Being-as-not-Death`, is not amenable to any such transformation if it is to retain its sense, the sense in which we mean _my_ Being is mutually exclusive with that of _my_ Death. We may say `Being-not-in-Death`, in which case the negation has only been rearranged, or we may say `Being-without-Death`, having only subsumed the negation into the `out`, which in itself negates the `with`. After a few such bouts of semantic gymnastics, the futility of the endeavor becomes apparent. At every turn, the "_essence_" of Death cannot be escaped. There is no way to traverse the boundary between Being and Death through language and representation without the operation of negation acting as the gatekeeper. 

Perhaps the reader may at this point wonder why we play [language games](#language-games), whether this method of discourse has any merit as it relates to the inquiry of truth. Terms such as `Being-before-Death` and `Being-as-not-Death` are by no means a rigorous foundation on which to build an analytical calculus. They do, however, in **Heideggerian** fashion, force the mind to confront how it, insofar that it is is a Being, relates to Death. If one abandons the pretense of sense and admits to the possibility of silliness, we may play this game where we attempt to map out the contours of Death as it relates to our world, using the medium of language and meaning. It is only when we allow ourselves this pretense, that we may see where it goes awry, and it is at the point where language fails us, that we begin to understand what it is that Death could possibly be. 

We might also remark at this point that Death's essential contradiction appears to arise through the intersection of its Nothingness with it's so-called `contingency`. Death is something that happens to us. Death is fixed as the endpoint in the sequence of causal relations that form our `factical` trajectory through the world. Every choice we make (<sup><sub>if it is a choice</sub></sup>) from the moment of our birth leads inevitably to our Death. Death is fixed in everyone's lives as the final point upon which we all ultimately come to rest. Death, in this sense, is `invariant`.

In physics, it was discovered in the late nineteenth century that no matter your mechanical frame of reference, i.e. how fast you are travelling, what forces are acting on you, etc., you will always measure the same speed of light. This was a counter-intuitive discovery that required a rethinking of the way things are, because we tended until that point to think of motion as additive, i.e. a baseball thrown from a moving train (<sub><sup>or car, in modern parlance</sup></sub>) travels with the speed imparted to it plus the speed of the train. This intuitive notion arises from our idea that motion is relative to space and that space is absolute. 

**Schopenhauer**, extending the ideas of **Kant**, was the first philosopher to see that space itself was nothing more than a relation the subject used to apprehend the world as representation, and thus it must only have Being for the subject. It was then discovered by **Einstein**, in the next centry, if the speed of light does not change with respect to your frame of reference, then its invariance leads to the relativity of space. Thus, **Einstein** provided the scientific and mathematical foundation of **Schopenhauer**'s philosophy. 

All this is to say, the invariance of nature provides the ultimate metric for the subjectivity of Being, the caliber to which all other measurements must scale. The speed of light is a constraint in the form of our representation, not space or time; and so it is experimentally verified that clocks tick slower the faster one moves, a phenomena (<sup><sub>in the truest sense of the word</sub></sup>) known as `time dilation`. This, in conjunction with the notion of relative motion, ensures science and mathematics have adequately expunged the notion of time and space existing in and of themselves. 

The relations that underlie our apprehension and perception arise through their ability to point _towards_ these absolutes. The form of our representation is time and space, thus these forms bend towards that which is invariant. 

Death, then, as its relation to our Being starts to emerge through the fog of negation, is not an object, i.e. representation, but a constraint imposed on the form of our representations. In the same way that time and space become relative metrics to accomodate the invarance of the speed of light[^11], our Being becomes a relative metric to accomodate the invariance of Death. 

In this sense, we say the ontological substratum of Being is Death.

[^10]: In the preceding when we say "_Being_", what we mean can be mostly nearly approximated, to the knowledge of the author, with the **Heideggerian** terminology of `Dasein`. _Being_ is understood through the sum of its possible semantical operations with respect to its object: `Being-there`, `Being-with`, `Being-towards`, etc. In what follows, we will attempt to tag on a few terms to the series and see how this alters its sum. 

[^11]: The speed of light might be more properly termed the `speed of Being`, as it relates to _metaphysics_. 

### Death-as-not-Concept

In the second case, Death cannot be conceptualized, except insofar as the Death of the Other makes ingress into the representations of my Being, but then, in this case, it is not _my_ Death that has been conceptualized, but the Death of the Other. The process of conceptualizing Death passes over my own experience of it and leaves me with an empty concept, a concept that does not have Being in the way **Platonic** concepts do, because the abstraction of the Death of the Other does not lead me any closer to an understanding of my own Death in the way the abstraction of love does lead me to understand what the love of the Other is, because I too have a phenomenal experience of love that I may, assuming a pretense of uncertainty, infer in the Other.

Furthermore, Death as a feeling is like neither love nor duty. The concept of Death induces a feeling, but it is not the feeling of Death that is felt in the way one feels love or duty, for if one felt Death, they would therefore be dead and incapable of feeling. In those instances when one is in the process of apprehending a concept and integrating it into their Being, such as love and its effects, it is a compulsion felt as distinctly as weight or normal force, albeit with a locomotion peculiar to its class. One is compelled to act a certain way because they feel, for lack of a better term, the corporeal sensation of the accompanying conception. 

Death is not a motive concept, in the sense that it induces in the conceiving subject the action denoted by its concept. There is no _phenomonology of Death_, no _qualia of Death_, no Being of Death for the subject, only what **Martin Heidegger** termed `Being-toward-death`. The subject can only orient themselves toward Death, but they can not bring it any closer without thereby ceasing to exist. 

### Language Games

The concept of `Being-toward-death`, this ontological polarity between Being and Death, brings with it a whole host of subjugated concepts that stand in relation to it: grief, horror, acceptance, denial, love, hate, anger, awe, adulation, worship. Indeed, one might be tempted to conclude Death is the fountainhead from which all other emotions spring. The only other analogous concept is to be found in the spiritual; for instance, in the Judeo-Christian concept of the `mysterium tremendum`, whereby the worshipper enters into a state of rapture, by turns jubliant and horrified, when considering the object of his or her worship. Death, in this sense, overlaps with the Holy. 

**Heidegger** liked to play language games. By `Being-toward-death`, he meant to contrast this with his term `Being-in-the-world`, in order to draw our attention to the prepositions connecting the objects in their conceptual repose. A Being can be _in_ world, whereas it can only be _toward_ Death, the relation in these phrases indicating by turns how the world contains our Being in such a way that we necessarily _fit_ into it as if it could no other way whereas Death always recedes away from our Being, a thing that can never _in_ our Being, which would preclude its status a _thing_ altogether. 

In one of the few true positive analogies possible with Death as one of its poles ( <sup><sub>for reasons that will shortly be discussed</sub></sup> ), Death in this respect is similar to the concept of a limit from real analysis. The existence of a limit relies on the subtle notion of mathematical Continuity. In our everyday understanding of Continuity, we tacitly assume a logical form whereby a set is ordered and this ordering is such that each term succeeds the previous in a contingent way so that the series becomes "_connected_"; every member in the set becomes the next member through the property of "_continuity_", in an almost mystical, transubstantive process; In travelling from point A to point B in space, one must travel through all intervening points and one does so in a way by which we mean "_continuous_". 

Our everyday intuition of Continuity skips over Zeno's paradox, i.e. the infinitely divisible length, without even considering its annihiliating consequences. As mathematics has discovered, though, this is a fallacy of our intuition. The subject objectifies Being into representative forms and we cannot help but discretize a continuum when abstracting it into our thoughts; it is only through the aid of symbolic logic, as **Bertrand Russell** put it, that we are able to construct the necessary mental apparatus to perceive the true nature of continuity. When we apply rigor to the definition of a limit, we are forced into a definition where we can only say what it means to _approach_ a point, never to _arrive_ at a point. 

The modern mathematical definition of a limit symbolizes exactly this idea: getting _infinitely_ close to a point without actually _arriving_ at it is logically equivalent to physically passing through the point being approached, so that is suffices to define the latter in terms of the former, i.e. the _delta-epsilon_ definition of a limit. Indeed, pointwise discontinuities are permitted within the theorems of differential and integral calculus. In other words, a curve connecting point A and point B is mathematically the same as another curve connecting point A and point B with a countably infinite number of points removed. The implication here is then that it is possible for something to exist without it having membership in the set of things we call _existence_; or to put it another way, the thing you are approaching need not even exist in order to approach it.

Continuity implies an abundance so excessive that it can, without contradiction, contain an _infinite_ number of Nothings. Within this statement we see a profound truth: our inability to understand the nature of things. This notion of Continuity does not make sense. Indeed, it takes a trained mathematician many years, except in cases of genius, to overcome the intuitions ingrained into our experience through our everyday lives that lead us to form an incorrect understanding of Continuity. 

In this way, we say Death is an ontological limit (<sup><sub>perhaps _the_ ontological limit</sub></sup>). Death is something that exists by virtue of our perpetual approach towards it, but this does not necessarily mean that Death is an existent thing. In the same way that a limit may approach a value only to find the value missing but nevertheless yield that self-same value, we approach Death. 

In this language game we are playing, we see why, then, it is possible to draw a positive connection between the concept of a limit and the concept of Death, despite Death's aversion to conceptualization. Because the limit attempts to express precisely what Schopenhaur called the `principle of sufficient reason` in space, and because all Being in space is subject to Death, the concept of a limit contains within it a seed of the original horror of Being: that something we perceive as existent when it comes to pass might reveal itself as Nothing at all. There is nothing to be found in the contingency of Being that can guarantee our existence. When we die, we cease to exist and then there is Nothing, or anyway there is a thing functionally equivalent Nothing so that the differences between the two are irrelevant. Moreover, there is no way to escape the gravitation of Nothing; from the moment of Life, the draw is palpable, or as **Heidegger** put it, "_when man is born, he is old enough to die_".

Death, then, is a strange type of concept, a oddity among things. It lacks content, it lacks Being, it cannot be observed, it cannot be felt, it recedes from our perception as we approach it, yet it is an inevitability no living Being can escape. What sort of thing, then, is Death? How do we begin to come to terms with it, if it cannot be understood?

## A Godelian Counterargument

A final argument may be raised against the supposition that Death is unknowable, an argument resulting from the exhaustion of philosophers; when they find the foundation of their logic crumbling beneath them and all other options gone, they retreat to the warm embrace of their one true ally: solipsism, but in this case, a perverse, negative sort of solipsism. 

If by positive solipsism we take to mean the impossibility of knowing whether anything outside ourselves exists or not, then by negative solipsism we mean the impossiblity of knowing, until we die, that Death is unknowable. To phrase it another way to make the form of the argument more apparent: that Death is unknowable is unknowable until we die. This statement resembles a tautology, i.e. A = A, but upon further reflection, the relation contained in the statement is one of recursion: that in order to know that Death is unknowable, we must first die, but to die we must first relinquish the ability to know in the first place, leaving us at the exact point where we started. The statement refers to its own form. We chase ourselves in circles, each point in our path eventually leading back to itself, never making any forward progress. 

To this argument we must finally concede victory. Despite the great efforts of history's philsophers and scientists, there is no way to ground the objectification of Being without assuming a subject exists to observe it, and there is no basis for the assumption of a subject. Thus does the contingency of Being evaporate into Nothing. 

This has led many astray into the realm of divine explanation, that something other than what is must provide the basis for what is, because clearly it is the case that things are. If their contingency cannot ultimately be found in ourselves, then it must be found _somewhere_ we reason. In this way, **Schopenhauer** ultimately violated his own `principle of sufficient reason` by positing something beyond what is, i.e. the Will, to explain what he himself said could only be explained via sufficiency and necessity. 



It is here we find the one support upon which logic may extend into Death: that of our own uncertainty. It appears as though our Being ends when we die, for all signs point to that conclusion. Our bodies age and decay, we experience pain and sickness, the ones around us die and pass from this world, the natural world itself rots and returns to dust. It is only natural to assumption that our `Being-in-the-world` will likewise cease, but then if we turn inward to examine that proposition, we are forced to admit it is only likely, not definite. There are no assurances we die, any more than that we exist. We have therefore entered into the realm of `why-not`, `as-if`, `as-possibility`.

It has oft been remarked the only true philosophical proposition is that of our own uncertainty, which as a proposition negates itself. Thus ends the problem of philosophy, an ouroboros destined to eat itself. The problems of philosophy, that of existence and Being, occur within this loop, and will therefore never be solvable. 

### Death-as-not-Analogy

We have, through the course of this work, attempted to cast Death into various analogies. An analogy brings forth into the attention the similarities contained in two or more concepts, so that their overlapping parts are brought to the foreground, while their disjoint parts fade into the background; Analogy plays the role of conjunction in linguistics, in that it intersects a set of concepts to reveal their common geography. Analogy, in this sense, is syntactic, rather than semantic; analogy is a bare relation that takes no opinion of its operands. It can therefore be applied haphazardly and without condition. That analogy is always possible can be seen in analogies that do not immediately yield to sense, as in "the chainsaw is a like a hot coffee on a cold morning"; the mind reels to find a plausible explanation. 

We might wonder here at the connection between analogy and possibility. Analogy as a logical form brings with it the notion of possibility. 

Consider the following proposition: " "_And_" and "_Or_" are logical operations ". What is the meaning nested "" in the preceding? Does it have meaning or is it merely syntactic sugar to bring into relief what is not apparent in the plainer and easily misinterpretted: "And and or are logical operations"? If the latter is the case, then the "" must represent the `principle of sufficient reason` itself; that is, in apprehending the meaning of the proposition we are forced into the position of objectifying its contents; or, put another way, we only apprehend our Being through representation; or, reitereated yet again, everything becomes object in perception. 

**Schopenhauer**, for this reason, talks about the `the objectification of the Will`, but the terminology adopted implies a complete metaphyiscal system where Being is a like a sieve through which the `noumena` pass into the `phenomenon`, i.e. a Schopenhauer's `objectification` is a one-to-one mapping of the world as it is and the world as it appears. His formulation hides the true nature of objectification, and thus the true nature of Being. He adequately accounts for the transformation of the existent into appearance, but he does not recognize this transformative process that brings existence into relief has within its operation a blind spot: `objectification` only makes sense if we admit two prior assumptions: that of _objects_, and that of _relations_. In other words, we say the table and the kitchen reveal their "_objecthood_" in relation to one another, in the same way the tabletop and legs reveal themselves in relation to one another. 
 
If the `Will` is a merely an objectifying force, then it will necessarily only come to Being as objects. It will only meet the world through objects. In apprehending the proposition, "_And and or are logical operations_", what exactly have we objectified? We have turned our gaze to the form of our representation, the relation embodied through its contingency. We are attempting to embed our form of representation in itself. 






But this can only be the case if the aforementioned mapping is one-to-one; if any other relation should obtain, for instance that two separate existent things should map to a singular appearance in our Being, then we must abandon **Schopenhauer**'s ontology.



In either case, the meaning given to the proposition can be understood only as the desire of consciousness to objectify. "_And_" and "_Or_" are clearly not objects, but rather the relations that unite objects in our Being, and when consciounsess turns on itself to reflect on its own form, it attempts to objectify the relations that orient it within the world.  



the only thing the null set has in common with a non-null set is Nothing
















## Sartre

The concept of Death as an objective fact within a complex of knowledge, however, refers to something that does not exist. It is a negative fact, an indication without source. In this sense, Death is similar to Sartre's `Being-for-Itself`, in that the essence of Death is a type of Being that can never be what it is, but can only be in the mode of not Being, a type of Nothingness. Sartre, like Schopenhaur, Heidegger and Kant, was an existentialist, and like those prior existentialists, he too liked to play language games. He thought the essential human nature was one of contradiction, that we cannot understand ourselves except in terms of a logic of absurdity, so his ontology is littered with contradictions that seek to capture the essential human nature.

During a lecture on symbolic logic, Russell was explaining the notion that anything and everything can be proved from a false premise. A student in the back of the class raised his hand and ask him to prove he was the pope if 1 = 2. Without missing a beat, Russell replied, "The pope and I form a set of two. But 2 = 1, therefore I am the pope". In this way, the geometry of the possibile becomes infinite in extent when contradiction forms its basis; this is what Sartre meant when he said `Being-for-itself` was "_condemned to be free_"; that is to say, the so-called `Dasein`, our experience of _Being there_, cannot help but exist in a world of uncountable possibility because its whole Being rests on a contradiction, that we can never be what we are, that is `Being-in-itself`, an entity totally contained in its representation.

The great project of pre-modern philosophy was the enumeration of the laws of Being. From Plato on up to Kant and ending sometime around Whitehead and Sartre, successive ontologies were constructed around the abstraction of Being and its mechanics into conceptual frameworks whereby "_theorems_" about the nature of Being could be deduced, or at least stated in a semi-rigorous language so the philosophical question could be understood with more granularity. 

There is however a glaring omission in each ontologies hitherto proposed as a framework for understanding Being. Only tangentially do these frameworks discuss and examine Death. Death is not baked into their foundation; it was only until the attempts of Camus, Bataille and Derrida that we have our first philosophical forays in the realm of the truly unknowable, and with them their approach was more aesthetic than it was analytical. There is a reason for this, as outlined in the introduction and expounded upon at great length: all the crystalline perfection of a systematic dissertation of Being is undone by the concept of Death. If an ontological system is held up to the light of Death, it immediately evaporates into sophistry. 

## Schopenhauer

As an example, Schopenhauer states the world exists for the subject, all time and space are merely the phenomenal intepretation of the `thing-in-itself`. In the absence of the subject, there is no time or space with which to apprehend Being, there is no form to be perceived, because the object presupposes the subject. In order to prevent this absurdity, he introduces `Will` as that which remains when the form of Being has been subtracted, i.e. the residue of Being when its appearance is dispersed. Time and space are contingent on `Will` objectifying existence and thus bringing the subject-object dyad into Being. 

Throughout history, when confronted with the impossibile, philosophers have invented a myriad of terms meant to somehow conceptualize it and thus circumvent its presence in their frameworks. For Schopenhaur it was `Will`, for Whithead it was `Process`, for the spiritual, it is the `soul`. The notion their frameworks for understanding Being might be poison from the start is something the mind rejects out of hand, for the mind can only apprehend things which are possible. So the dialectic continues, forever until the end of time; the human will repeatedly deny his or her existence is not Nothing and is thereby something, and in the process, he or she will bring into existence entire conceptual frameworks meant to prove it so, only to discover them empty and devoid of meaning when made to stand against the world. 

What Schopenhauer did not consider, perhaps because thermodynamics was still in infancy and its second law had only been crudely stated by the time he published _The World as Will and Representation_, is what happens when everything is dead, for that is inevitable end of all things in an entropic universe. The optimist's hope that procreation will sustain life indefinitely is absurd; even if life were somehow shifted into the digital realm and silicone were imbued with consciousness, the possibility of death cannot be removed; it lurks in the quantum uncertainty, in the random fluctations that might thereby disorder whatever form conscioussness has assumed; it resides in the catacylsmic, in the afterbirth of violent supernova, in the vast emptiness of space where nothing can be found for literal eternities; it exists in the mundane, in graduations of a thermometer, in the crumbling edges of cliffs, in the unlucky moments when the universe contorts itself into a blade and strikes. Forever is our Being inextricably linked with its own end; and when the sum of all such Beings is taken in total, there can be no denying there will come point when the last subject in Schopenhauer's dyad has perished. And what happens at that point? Does the world cease to exist? And if that is the case, at the point when only Nothing remains, in what sense can we say anything ever really existed? There will be no proof to which to point, no observer to lay claim to the world. Everything that ever was will be as a dream, except even a dream is recalled however briefly upon waking. When everyone is dead, there will be no one to wake.

There is in this problem illuminated the meaning of solipism, to which no satisfactory answer can ever be given. My Being is just so that it can never know if it truly exists. Any ontology must necessarily become solipism at the point in which the subject enters into it. 

## Indetermination

Wittgenstein used the following diagram to illustrate the nebulousness of conceptualization.

![](./assets/wittgenstein_rabbit_duck.svg)

We have here an interesting representation of _something_. It hard to pin down what _exactly_ it is, though. It is at once a rabbit and a duck, but neither concept fully emerges in the mind until a point of view is selected. Once the point is selected and the concept brought forth, the other concept evaporates entirely from the perception. In order to perceive the hidden concept, the perception of the other must likewise evaporate. It is only with great effort that we are able to hold both concepts in mind simultaneously, and furthermore this requires a letting go, i.e. the reconceptualization of the image into a unity of something like a rabbit-duck, a new existent thing; Schopenhauer would say the `Will` has thus objectified a "_lower grade_" phenomenon into a higher order `thing-in-itself`; This is what Schopenhauer meant by the `objectification of will`, or the `graduations of will`. Whitehead would say an `actual entity` has been `concretized`, and refer to the totality as a `Process`.

If we do not admit to Schopenhauer's postulate, namely that once representation is removed the remainder is `Will`, how far can we go in understanding our representation of this image? What assumptions are necessary and sufficient in order to understand our inability to see both images in this picture at once without thereby assimilating them into something new? 

In order to avoid the addition of superfluous terms like `Will` or `Soul` that must ultimately be given in addition to what is necessary and sufficient, we shall say: our perception of an object cannot exist without a concept to ground it. 

This does not afford much leeway in which to make deductions about the nature of conception. With this definition, we are forced into the position the image has no definite concept to encompass it all at once. And this is exactly what Wittgenstein meant to show: that perception and conceptualization are not definite things, but instead are fuzzy, like overlapping circles, where a point can claim to be in multiple circles at once. It is only when a single circle is drawn into the attention that we see the point in relation to it alone, but this does not contradict its membership in other circles. 

It is strange to the human to say the image is both things at once and neither at the same time. We are repulsed from this conclusion in the same way we do not admit an object can be in two positions at once without thereby becoming separate objects; space is nothing more than the relationship of objects to one another, and to claim this relationship might be something other than what it is defies our ability to understand. But Kant has already shown this as nothing more than our inability to know the `noumena`, the existent thing. What is flawed is our phenomenal apprehension, that we are confined to the thing's representation in time and space; the thing remains, but our perception cannot, as it were, get a grip on it. It can not hold it firmly in a single logical proposition.





Death, in its inestimatible way, has yet another unique property. For it is always with us in the form of possibility. This is not like other possibilities, which only emerge when we comport ourselves in a specific way. In other words, a thing is possible insofar that we understand how it may come to be, given where, when and how we are at this current moment in time. For this reason, we can understand propositions such as "the human had five eyes" or "the car drank a quart of whiskey" in terms of their possible explanation with respect to Being as hypotheticals that may manifest under the right circumstances, like a chemical compound that only forms its crystalline structure within a restricted range of temperature and pressure, whereas propositions such as "the distance is blue" or "five is salty" can only assume possibilities if we admit different interpretations of their respective forms. In this way, we say possibilitiy is contingent on Being. 

Any action we take depends on our relationship to the world, and therefore all possibility is possibility only insofar that it bears a relation to the world; we have the possibility of apprehension and understanding because our Being in space is composed of location and orientation and the relative arrangements of the representative forms of our perception; we have the possibility of movement because our Being in time is composed of change, i.e. the transformation of spatial relations across a dimension irreducible to space. Possibility is the enumeration of all trajectories in possibility-space emanating from a point, where the axes decompose into the modes of our Being, i.e. causality, time and space. 

**Schopenhauer** correctly argued that space and time are nothing more than the representative form assumed by our perception of Being. They condition the possibilities of Being. They are, in a sense, the substance of possibility. 

There is, however, one possibility that does not obey this rule. 

Death is the only possibility that has no contingency on Being, on so-called `facticity`, in the same way we say a horizontal line has no dependence on the value of the x-axis; it haunts every moment, throughout eternity, irrespective of where, how or when we find ourselves. 




Indeed, Death is always with us but we do not apprehend it in our Being until we first see its outline in the absence of another's Being, i.e. the Death of the Other. As children, we do not understand Death until we first understand the Other, that outside of ourselves are others like us, unknowable yet inferrable. Knowledge of death then follows when we finally confront it in the end of the Other.
