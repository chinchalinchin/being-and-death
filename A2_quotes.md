## The Heights of Despair

### The Passion for the Absurd

> There are people who are destined to taste only the poison in things, from whom any surprise is a painful surprise and any experience a new occasion for torture. If someone were to say to me that such suffering has subjective reasons, relative to the individual's particular makeup, I would then ask: Is there an objective criterion for evaluating suffering? Who can say with precision that my neighbor suffers more than I do or that Jesus suffered more than all of us? There is no objective standard because suffering cannot be measured according to the external stimulation or local irritation of the organism, but only as it is felt and reflected in conciousness. Alas, from this point of view, any hierarchy is out of the question. Each person remains with his own suffering, which he believes absolute and unlimited. How much would we diminish our personal suffering if we were to compare it to all the world's sufferings until now, to the most horrifying agonies and the most complicated tortues, the most cruel deaths and the most painful betrayals, all the lepers, all those burned alive or starved to death? Nobody is comforted in his sufferings by the thought that we are all mortals, nor does anybody who suffers really find comfort in the past or present suffering of others. Because in this organically insufficient and fragmentary world, the individual is set to live fully, wishing to make of his own existence an absolute. Each subjective existence is absolute to itself. For this reason each man lives as if he were the center of the universe or the center of history. Then how could his suffering fail to be absolute? I cannot understand another's suffering in order to diminish my own. Comparisons in such cases are irrelevant, because suffering is an interior state, in which nothing external can help.

## Foundations of Arithmetic

### Section III: Views on One and Oneness

> Only through the possibility of something not being wise does the assertion that Solon is wise gain a sense. The content of a concept diminishes as its extension grows; if the latter becomes all-embracing, then the content must be lost entirely.

> Whilst we can combine "Solon was wise" and "Thales was wise" into "Solon and Thales were wise", we cannot say, "Solon and Thales were one". The impossibility of this would not be perceived if "one" as well as "wise" were a property both of Solon and Thales"

> If I say, "Venus has 0 moons", then there is no moon or aggregate of moons to assert anything of at all; but instead it is the concept 'moon of Venus' to which a property is ascribed, namely, that of including nothing under it.

> That a statement of number expresses something factual independent of our conceptions can only surprise those who regard a concept as something subjective like an idea. But this view is wrong. If, for example, we subordinate the concept of body to the concept of what has weight, or the concept of whale to the concept of mammal, then we are thereby asserting something objective. Now if the concepts were subjective, then the subordination of one to the other, as a relation between them, would also be subjective, just as a relation between ideas. 

> If, for example, all concepts under which only one object falls, are collected under one concept, then oneness is a mark of this concept. Under it would fall, for example, the concept "moon of the Earth", though not the heavenly body itself. Thus, a concept can fall under a higher one, that is to say, a concept of second order.


> Here is the historical moment where logic first turned towards its own foundations. Here is where the representative form of mathematics began its recursive journey inwards, towards itself.

> In fact, would it not be most appropriate to call a concept the unit that relates to the Number which belongs to it? We can then give a sense to assertions that are made about the unit, that it is separated from its surroundings and indivisible. For the concept to which the number is ascribed does in general delimit what falls under it in a definite way. The concept "letter in the word 'Zahl'" delimits the Z from the a, the a from the h, and so on. The concept "syllable in the word 'Zahl'" picks out the word as a whole and as indivisible in the sense that the parts do not now fall under the concept. 

### Section IV: The Concept of Number

> All that can be demanded of a concept on the part of logic and for rigour of proof is its sharp boundary, that for every object it is determined whether it falls under the concept or not. Now this demand is completely satisifed by a concept containing a contradiction such as "not identical with itself"; since of every object it is known that it does not fall under such a concept.

### Section V: Conclusion

> The laws of number will not need, as Baumann thinks, to prove their worth in practice in order to be applicable to the external world; for in the external world, in the totality of the spatial, there are no concepts, no properties of concepts, no numbers. The laws of number are thus not really applicable to external things: they are not laws of nature. But they are certainly applicable to judgements that are made about things in the external world: they are laws of laws of nature.

# Heidegger, Martin

## What is Metaphysics? Section II: The Elaboration of the Question

> What is the nothing? Our very first approach to this question has something unusual about it. In our asking we posit the nothing in advance as something that "is" such and such; we posit it as a being. But that is exactly what it is distinguished from. Interrogating the nothing--asking what and how it, the nothing, is--turns what is interrogated into its opposite. The question deprives itself of its own object. Accordindly, every answer to this question is also impossible from the start. For it necessarily assumes the form: the nothing "is" this or that. With regard to the nothing, question and answer alike are inherently absurd.



> For thinking, which is always essentially thinking about something, must act in a way contrary to its own essence when it thinks of the nothing.

> Does not the "not", negatedness, and thereby negation too represent the higher determiniation under which the nothing falls as a particular kind of negated matter? is the nothing given only because the "not", i.e. negation, is given? Or is it the other way around? Are negation and the "not" given only because the nothing is given? That has not been decided; it has not even been raised expressly as a question. We assert that the nothing is mor original than the "not" and negation. 

> If this thesis is right, then the possibility of negation as an act of the intellect, and thereby the intellect itself, are somehow dependent upon the nothing. Then how can the intellect hope to decide about the nothing? Does the ostensible absurdity of question and answer with respect to the nothign in the end rest solely in a blind conceit of the far-ranging intellect?

> If nothing itself is to be questioned as we have been questioning it, then it must be given beforehand. We must able to encounter it.

> Where shall we seek the nothing?


> The nothing is the complete negation of the totality of beings.

> As surely as we can never comprehend absolutely the whole of beings in themselves we certainly do find ourselves stationed in the midst of beings that are revealed somehow as a whole. In the end an essential distinction prevails between comprehending the whole of beings in themselves and finding oneself in the midst of beings as a whole.

# Sartre, Jean-Paul

## Being and Nothingness

### Introduction: Pursuit of Being, Chapter 1: The Origin of Nevation, Section V: The Origin of Nothingness

> If Nothingness can be conceived neither outside of Being, nor in terms of Being, and if on the other hand, since it is non-being, it cannot derive from itself the necessary force to "nihiliate itself", "where does Nothingness come from"?

> I take refuge in reflecton, but the latter has only an undetermined future to offer. This means that in establishing a certyain conduct as a possbility and precisely becasue it is "my" possbility, I am aware that "nothing" can compel me to adopt taht conduct. Yet I am indeed already there in the future; it is for the sake of that being which I will be there at the turning of the path that I now exert all my strength, and in this sense there is already a relation between my future being and my present being. But a "nothingness" has slipped into the heart of this relation; I "am" not the self which I will be. First I am not that self because time separates me from it. Secondly, I am not that self because what I am is not the foundation of what I will be. Finally I am not self because no actual existent can determine strictly what I am going to be.

> I am the self which I will be, in the mode of not being it.

> If "nothing" compels me to save my life, _nothing_ prevents me from precipitating myself into the abyss

> Thus the self which I am depends on the self which I am not yet to the exact extent that the self which I am not yet does not depend on the self which I am.

> We must recognize that there is never a motive "in" consciousness; motives are only "for" consciousness. And due to the very fact that the motive can arise only as appearance, it constitutes itself as ineffective. Of course it does not have externality of a temporal-spatial thing; it always belong to subjectivity and it is apprehended as "mine" 

### Chapter 1: Immediate Structures of the For-Itself, Section I: Presence to Self

> Presence to self, on the contrary, supposes that an impalpable fissure has slipped into being. If being is present to itself, it is because it is not wholly itself. Presence is an immediate deterioration of coincidence, for it supposes separation. But if we ask ourselves at this point "what it is" which separates the subject from himself, we are forced to admit it is "nothing". Ordinarily what separates is a distance in space, a lapse in time, a psychological difference, or simply the individuality of two co-presents--in short, a "qualified" reality. But in the case which concerns us, 'nothing' can separate the consciousness of belief from belief, since belief is "nothing other" than the consciousness of belief.

> Nothingness is always an elsewhere. It is the obligation for the for-istelf never to exist except in the form of an elswhere in relation to itself, to exist as a being which perpetually effects in itself a break in being; it is onyl a perpetual reference of self to self, of the reflection to the reflecting, of the reflecting to the reflection. This reference, however, does not provoke an infinite movement in the heart of the for-itself but is given within the unity of a single act. The infinite movement belongs only to the reflective regard which wants to apprehend the phenomenon as a totality and which is referred from the reflection to the reflecting, from the reflecting to the reflection without being able to stop. Thus nothingness is this hole in being, this fall of the in-itself toward the self, the fall by which the for-itself is constituted.

> Nothingness is the putting into question of being by being--that is, precisely consciousness or for-itself. It is an absolute event which comes to being by means of being and which, without having being, is perpetually sustained by being. Since being-in-itself is isolated in its being by its total positivity no being can produce being and nothing can happen to being through being--except for nothingness. Nothingness is the peculiar possibility of being and its unique possibility. Yet this original possibility appears only in the absolute act which realizes it. Since nothingness is nothingness of being, it can come to being only through being itself. Of course it comes to being through a particular being, which is human reality. But this being is constituted as human reality inasmuch as this being is nothign but the original project of its own nothingness. Human reality is being in so far as within its being and for its being it is the unique foundation of nothingess at the heart of being.

> We know the question posed by physiologists: "How can we set upright the objects which are painted upside down on our retina?" We know as well the answer of the philosophers: "There is no problem. An object is upright or inverted in relation to the rest of the universe. To perceive the whole universe inverted means nothing, for it would have to be inverted in relation to something." But what paritcularly interests us is the origin of this false problem. It is the fact that people have wanted to link my consciousness of objects to the body of the Other. Here are the candle, the crystalline lens, the inverted image on the screne of the retina. But to be exact, the retina enters here into a physical system: it is a "screen" and only that; the crystalline lens is a _lens_ and only a lens; both are homogeneous in their being with the candle which completes the system. Therefore we have deliberately chosen the physical point of view--i.e., the point of view of the outside, of exteriority--in order to study the problem of vision; we have considered a dead eye in the midst of the visible world in order to account for the visibility of this world. Consequently, how can we be surprised later when consciousness, which is absolute interiority, refuses to allow itself to be beound to this object? The relations which I establish between the Other"s body and the external object are really existing relations, but they have for thier being the being of the for-others.

# Schopenhauer

## The World as Will and Representation

### Book 1: The World as Representation, First Aspect, Chapter 1

> "The world is my representation": this is a truth valid with reference to every living and knowing being, although man alone can bring it into reflective,abstract consciousness. If he really does so, philosophical discernment has dawned on him. It then becomes clear and certain to him that he does not know a sun and an earth, but only an eye that sees a sun, a hand that feels an earth; that the world around him is there only as representation, in other words, only in reference to another thing, namely that which represents, and this is himself. If any truth can be expressed "a priori", it is this; for it is the statement of that form of all possible and conceivable experience, a form that is more general than all others, than time, space and causality, for all these presuppose it. While each of these forms, which we have recognized as so many particular modes of the principle of sufficient reason, is valid only for a particular class of representations, the division into object and subject, on the other hand, is the common form of all those classes; it is that form under which alone any representation, of whatever kind it be, abstract or intuitive, pure or empirical, is generally possible and conceivable. Therefore no truth is more certain, more independent of all others, and less in need of proof than this, namely that everything that exists for knowledge, and hence the whole of this world, is only object in relation to the subject, perception of the perceiver, in a word, representation. Naturally this holds good of the present as well as of the past and future, of what is remotest as well as of what is nearest; for it hollds good of time and space themsevles, in which alone all these distinctions arise. Everything that in anyway belongs and can belong to the world in inevitably associated with this being-conditioned by the subject, and it exists only for the subject. The world is representation.

# Whitehead, Alfred

## Process and Reality

### Chapter 1: Speculative Philosophy, Section II

> In philosophic theory there is an ultimate which is actual in virtue of its accidents. It is only then capable of characterization through its accidental embodiments, and apart from these accidents is devoid of actuality. In the philosophy of organism this ultimate is termed "creativity"; and God is its primordial, non-temporal (non-historical) accident. In monistic philosophies, Spinoza's or absolute idealism, this ultimate is God, who is also equivalently termed "The Absolute". In such monistic schemes, the ultimate is illegimately allowed a final, "eminent" reality, beyond that ascribed to any of its accidents. In this general position the philosophy of organism seems to approximate more to some strains of Indian, or Chinese thought, than to western Asiatic, or European, thought. One side makes process ultimate; the other side makes fact ultimate.

### Chapter 1: Speculative Philosophy, Section V

> The point is that every proposition refers to a universe exhibiting some general systematic metaphysical character. Apart from this background, the separate entities which go to form the proposition, and the proposition as a whole, are without determinate character. Nothign has been defined, because every definite entity requires a systematic universe to supply its requisite status. Thus every proposition proposing a fact must, in its complete analysis, propose the general character of the universe required for that fact. There are no self-sustained facts, floating in nonentity.

> One practical aim of metaphysics is the accurate analysis of propositions; not merely of metaphysical propositions, but of quite ordinary propositions such as "There is beef for dinner today" and "Socrates is mortal" The one genus of facts which constitutes the field of some special sciences requires some common metaphysical presupposition respecting the universe.

> Language is thoroughly indeterminate, by reason of the fact that every occurrence presupposes some systematic type of environment.

> The truth itself is nothing else than how the composite nature of the organice actualities of the world obtain adequate representations in the divine nature.

### Chapter 1: Section VI

> Whenever we attempt to express the matter of immediate experience, we find that its understanding leads us beyond itself, to its contemporaries, to its past, to its future, and to the universals in terms of which its definiteness is exhibited. But such universals, by their very character of universality, embody the potentiality of other facts with variant types of definiteness. Thus the understanding of the immediate brute fact requires its metaphysical interpretation as an item in the world with some systematic relation to it. When thought comes upon the scene, it finds the intreperations as matters of practice. Philosophy does not initiate interpretations. Its search for a rationalistic scheme is the search for more adequate criticism, and fore more adequate justifications of the interpretations which we perforce employ. Our habitual experience is a complex of failure and succes in the enterprise of interpretation. If we desire a record of uninterpreted experience, we must ask a stone to record its autobiography. Every scientific memoir in its records of the "facts" is shot through and through with interpretation. The methodology of rational interpretaiton is the product of the fitful vagueness of consciounsess. Elements which shine with immediate distinctness, in some circumstances, retire into penumbral shadow in other circumstances, and into black darkness on other occasions. And yet all occasions proclaim themselves as actualities within the flux of a solid world, demanding a unity of interpretation.

> Philosophy is the self-correction by consciousness of its own initial experience of subjectivity.

> Religion is an ultimate craving to infuse into the insistent particularity of emotion that non-temporal generality which primarily belongs to conceptual thought alone.

> Religion is centered upon the harmony of rational thought with the sensitive reaction to the percepta from which experience originates. Science is concerned with the harmony of rational thought with the percepta themselves. When sciences deals with emotions, the emotions in question are percepta and not immediate passions--other people's emotions and not our own; at least our own in recollection, and not in immediacy. Religion deals with the formation of the experiencing subject; whereas science deals with the objects, which are the data forming the primary phase in this experience. The subject originates from, and amid, given conditions; sciences conciliates thought with this primary matter of fact; and religion conciliates the thought involved in the process with the sensitive reaction involved in that same process. The process is nothign else thatn the experiencing subject itself. In this explanation it presumed that an experiencing subject in one occasion of sensitive reaction to an actual world. Science finds religious experiences among its percepta; and religion finds scientific conetps among the conceptual experiences to be fused with particular sensitive reactions.

> The conclusion of this discusssion is, first, the assertion of the old doctine that breadth of thought reacting with intensity of sensitive experience stands out as an utlimate claim of existence.

> There are simplicities connected with the motion of a bar of steel which are obscured if we refuse to abstract from the individual molecules; and there are certain simplicites concerning the behaviour of men which are obscured if we refuse to abstract from the individual peculiarities of particular specimens. In the same way, there are certain general truths, about actual things in the common world of activity, which will be obscured when attention is confined to some paritcular detailed mode of considering them. These general truths, involved in the meaning of every particular notion respecting the actions of things, are the subject matter for speculative philosophy. 

> Its ultimate appeal is to the general consciousness of what in practice we experience.
