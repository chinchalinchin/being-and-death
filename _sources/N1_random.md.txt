# Note #2: Random Thoughts

Random thoughts that have not yet shown their place within the work. 

## 1. Proof by Contradiction

The great workhorse of mathematics is proof by contradiction. An assumption is made, an absurdity is shown to result from the assumption, therefore the assumption is shown to be false. In this way was modern mathematics constructed, by outlining the truth and demarcating its boundary with falsity. Anyone who has studied higher mathematics will attest to the way most mathematical proofs work by letting the truth "_in through the back door_"[^27], that is to say, they work by showing what cannot be the case in order to prove the opposite must be so, but this gets us no closer to _why_ it is so.

This method does not reveal the "_intuition_" of the theorem to the observer; indeed one can comprehend a proof without understanding anything about what it trying to say and in the converse direction, one may understand a concept without being able to grasp its proof in the slightest.

So it is with induction: a proof of induction, and therefore a proof _by_ induction, relies on a contradiction that an element belongs to two mutually exclusive sets, which we are forced to admit is absurdity, therefore we conclude induction must be true; but nowhere in the proof do we see why the form in an induced series is transmitted from one term to the next. Likewise, a student can spend an entire academic career studying the axioms and theorems of real analysis and still have no intuition for how a falling stone's trajectory traces a parabola with respect to time, despite having memorized a series of proofs that show how to go from set theory to differential calculus.

This, however, is a logical method well-suited for Death, since as we have noted, Death will never be understood. The only course we may avail ourselves of is to define what Death is not and trace its outline through the ink of negation. Indeed, this will be the course of the present work. We shall attempt to negate our way towards an understanding of Death, an understanding that we have already noted is impossible. _C'est la vie_.

## 2. Hamiltonian Mechanics

To those who hold fast to determinism and cling to the belief that possibility is psychological and not ontological, that the universe is a clockwork with initial conditions and laws of evolutions, one need consider the d'Alembert Principle and the work of Hamiliton and Lagrange.

While Newton was in England developing his three laws from which he would deduce a broad array of phenomenon, such as planetary motion, geometric optics, etc., work was being done in continential Europe to express physical law in terms of an extremum principle. Rather than asserting the three laws of the motion as the primitives of mechanics, Hamilton and Lagrange showed these laws were the result of a more fundamental principle, that of _least action_:


> The trajectory of a particle between two fixed points in _time_ is such that it extremizes the quantity of _action_. 

Where _action_ is defined as the difference between the potential and kinetic energy in a system integrated over the time period in consideration, i.e. the accumulated excess energy over and above what is proscribed by the system itself. By asserting motion is such that it minimizes this quantity, the Newton's laws naturally fall out of the mathematical balance of energy, i.e. the conservation of energy.

By positing the laws of motions thus, Hamilton and Lagrange showed that within their formulation, they inherently contain the possibility of the world. It is as if the universe looked at all the possible lines that connected two points and brought into existence only that which satisfies the conditions of necessity, i.e. _least action_. 

Except when we say universe in the preceding, we should be careful, for what we truly mean is the subject apprehending the universe, the _Dasein_ that reflects on its Being. Hamilton has expressed in his formulation a ontological primitive, i.e. a necessity of form.  

## 3. Neural Networks

No doubt the advance of machine learning and artifical intelligence has helped mislead philosophy back into the rationalist trap in which it has so often found itself stuck throughout history. The results of these fields are staggering and alluring, as if everything we are might be reduced to the mechanical equations of a machine, as if consciousness and Being were contained in the regression coefficient matrices underlying machine learning and not _their application over time and space_. 

TODO 

It seems likely that we will, in the near future, have an algorithm capable of producing a process that yields digital sentience, but we must be careful to understand the implications of such an algorithm. It will not be the symbols themselves that offer up another soul to the universal meat grinder, but the utter incomprehensibility of their results uninterprettable without the presupposition of the Other that will give rise to digital Being. We should not expect to find the meaning of the algorithm in the instructions it prescribes, but in the actual conceptualizations formed by the algorithm.

Neural networks provide an interesting case study in Being, if we suppose these models do in fact possess some resemblance to actuality. A neural network, as currently understood in computer science, is nothing more than a recursive tree of regression models, where each node in a layer of the tree is dependent on the nodes from the previous layer and in turn feeds into the next layer.

When

[neural network image goes here]

For instance, we might model our brain's image recognition as a network that takes as its initial input the excitation levels of the red, blue and green cones in our eyes. The first level of inputs would take the form of a `(R, G, B)` vector and produce a tree of output that feeds into the next layer of the network, analyzes the cross-interactions of each input variable in the previous layer, and so on, until finally reaching a concept node that maps the initial input through the layers of the network to an concept such as _dog_, _cat_ or _boat_. 

Model trees like this can be calibrated to datasets, so each node of the tree has a formulae for constructing the input to the next level. We feed into the model datasets that have been pre-labeled, i.e. this image contains a cat, this image contains a dog, etc. This network, or tree, of models is then trained against this control data set, so that it can be used to ingest unknown images and render predictions as to their content.

## 4. Origins of Language I

Language has much to tells us about the origins of humanity, but it is coy in its explanations, never offering them except obliquely, via hidden connections and etymological trees. However, all etymologies eventually reach a point of no return, where they can go back no further. By necessity, the origins of languages extend beyond the pages of history, for history as a field of inquiry is predicated on the medium of language to express it. By history, we mean our knowledge of the world _before us_, i.e., not the remembered tracjetory of our Being that led us to the here and now, our `factic` history, but the world state trajectory that would seem to have conditioned our emergence as ontic Beings before we were capable of forming memories.

It is an interesting question whether or not this contingence of history on language is unique to human existence or is indeed a property of our collective Being. That a child is not born with language, but acquires it, and would become mute in the absence of language in its formative years, suggests communication is not a direct consequence of genetics; rather it suggests language is a only a possibility of Being, something that need not have occurred, but did, as evidence by these words. It is an inheritance mechanism abstracted on top of genetics, built by intellects that came to understand the primary mode of their Being as communication.

**Immanuel Kant** would call language `synthetic`, in that it presupposes the forms of space and time, but is not deducible through the concepts of space and time alone. 

If the origin of language can be generalized through the fog of uncertain history at all, then it must be said to be the result of humans coming to be and finding themselves in the world with the Other, i.e. the lurking possibility of Beings like themselves hiding in the forms they perceive. Every word we use to express a thought was claimed after a great primordial war, where one side was that of diverse intellects, armed with the ability to interpret each other's Being within their own, and the other was the Nothingness that separated these intellects from knowing each other directly, in the immediate way they knew themselves. 

Imagine a pane of glass separating you from another person. Imagine further you do not share a common language, i.e. English, so that the possibility of reading lips is removed. Now, remove all knowledge gained from culture and society, all the lessons you learned in elementary school, all the route memorization where letters and numbers were ingrained into your understanding of the world, all the associations learned from your parents in your infancy when you were first discovering that language could signify and represent. 

Now imagine the person on the other side has food and you do not. Imagine there is a slot in the glass, not dissimilar to a prison cell, through which objects can be passed. The only way for you to feed yourself is to somehow cajole, or otherwise induce, in the person on the other side of the glass the idea of passing food through the slot that connects your rooms. 

How is conversation to be had in this thought experiment? How do you express yourself to the party on the other side of the glass, and visa versa? Through what symbolic space are we to project our intentions? In order to communicate, we must necessarily invent a new language. This is the situation our primitive ancestors found themselves in  (<sup><sub>metaphorically speaking, of course</sub></sup>), when they first attempted the experiment of communication.

**Wittgenstein** pointed out that language is akin to a set of tools. The purpose of a tool is a product of the problem it solves. Likewise, the meaning of a word is only drawn from its context, and we often mistake that meaning as the _thingness_ of the word, when applied in a different context it would have yielded a different use. "_It is as if someone were to say: a game consists in moving objects about on a surface according to certain rules..."--and we replied: You seem to be thinking of board games, but there are others. You can make your definition correct by expressly restricting it to those games_"[^Wittgenstein#2]


A hammer may be used to strike just as well as pry, and in each case its usage reveals a different purpose, as if slotting into a nexus made solely for it to slot. **Wittgenstein** cautions, however, not to conclude, then, that a tool "_serves to modify something_"[^Wittgenstein#3], for what is modified by the measuring tape, the level or the volt-meter? You may reply, "_our knowledge_", but is this the same type of modification undergone by the struck nail, or are we merely stretching our definitions to cover a gamut of phenomenon?

"_What confuses us is the uniform appearance of words_"[^Wittgenstein#4], i.e. 

## 5. Origins of Language II

TODO

What significance does the invention/discovery of the linguistic component of Being[^6] bring with it in the history of language? Can we say definitively the notion of Being did not precede language, historically speaking? Did humans have any idea what was meant by _Being_ without a representation that signified, through its related parts, all the ways a thing could be: this _is_ blue, this _is_ dangerous, this _is_ love. Were the concepts of blue, danger and love pre-existing, or were they a by-product of the development of language?

What would language be expressing, if not the Being of its subject matter? Is the concept of Being implicitly contained in even the most rudimentary of languages, or is it explicit, in that those who are said to speak, must first recognize themselves as Beings and have their thoughts ordered by a mental heuristic that approximates the linguistic quanta of Being? 

How would one talk about abstractions like color and sound without the notion of Being? How would one reference the blueness of ink without saying _this part is blue_ and _this part is ink_, and then demonstrating, through their use, how it is that a thing is said to be blue and how it is a thing is said to be ink?

TODO

One may imagine a primitive language composed of only signs that represent _blue_, _ink_, _not_, and likewise, one may imagine a speaker of this language attempting to teach an ignorant bystander of its definitions and how these words represent the subtle notion of _blue ink_. We imagine the instructor holding up a sample of blue against a sample of various colors, pointing to one color and annunciating "blue" while pointing to the other and annunciating "not blue". In the same way, we can imagine the word _ink_ being learned, as the instructor points to instances of ink and declares them "ink" and, inversely, points to instances of other things and declares them "not ink". 

In this theoretical language we have just constructed, we take note of a few features. First, we must necessarily introduce negation as a clarifying agent. A language composed of just _blue_ and _ink_ would have no way of specifying what things are neither of those two concepts. Negation is necessary for language to be anything other than the subjective mapping of signs of things; it is through negation that we can make clear the boundaries of a concept to the learner of the language; without negation, there is no way to differentiate the uniqueness of blue from things that _are_ blue. If we say a thing _is_ blue, how do we know this word isn't a proper name, or an indication of its heaviness? Because we have learned, via negation, all the different types of things that are not blue, in particular red things, green things, yellow things, etc., and have come to understand what blue _is_ insofar as the distance between _blue_ things and _not blue_ things is marked by graduations of color. 

There is another feature of this theoretical language we must investigate. Nowhere in its definitions do we immediately notice a sign that represents _Being_. This is because we are accustomed to language being given to us in written form. Language, however, is merely representation and representations need not be written down on paper. Anything can stand for anything else, as long as it is affixed to a interpretation where its meaning is determinate. The notion of _Being_ in the preceding arises through the instructor pointing to a particular thing and declaring what it is. The motion of pointing is, in fact, a symbol in this language, an object within the representation that directs the attention to the content of its proposition. In our theoretical language, the symbol for Being collapses into Being itself, i.e. the instructor uses his own Being as leverage by which to direct the attention of his pupil to Being of blue. _Blue_, he says, pointing with the tip of his finger to a sample of color, indicating the commonality shared between the Being of his finger and the Being of color, that is to say, Being itself. 

TODO

In a certain way, the concept of blue identified as belonging, in Being, to the parts of a complex identified as a pen, has its meaning tied up in its relation to the color of other things. We can separate blue from the other colors by enumerating _this is not blue; this is red_, _this is not blue; this is green_, but we cannot separate blue from the thing itself,.e. we say _this is blue ink_, and this thing we have that we call _blue_ink_ cannot be called as such without the color blue Being a part of the thing. 

The Being of color is partitioned within its concept, so that each color is separate from other colors while still retaining the _colorness_ that binds them as a mode of representation, but color is not separated from the thing of which it is an attribute. In other words, the color _blue_ obtains its meaning through its relation to the other concepts it find within the annals of language, but only insofar as that relation is a representation of something existent. 

How would motion be captured in language, if an object that was previously somewhere else cannot be identified as an object that is now here through the relation of Being, i.e. _what was over there is now here_? 

Without Being, there is no way to draw the commonality of things outside of themselves into a higher order. The notion of _is_ provides the basis by which things are differentiated into things. 

The modern world has, by virtue of its historicality, filled in the meaning of most words we know, so that when we come to be, we are no longer inventing, but discovering the meaning of language, or so it seems. We learn the words of the Other as if they were objects unto themselves, with their meaning contained in the ligatures of script, using words as a bootstrap to pull our own imagination into word-space. This process, however, hides the true origin of language in ourselves. 

Language begins in Being. It is a way of describing the nature of things. THe world can be known through information ebcause there is a correspondence of forms between the parts of a language and their complex and the world at large. The way we are in the world, that is the image projected up through the lines of language. 

It must have been surprising to the first being who recognized in language the image of the world. One is tempted to posit that exact moment as the historical origin of sentience. Akin to a photograph or a painting, a sentence is a reflection of Being; even when a painting depicts a fiction, it stil does so through the dimensions of necessity, through color and perspective, through representation; the same can be said of a sentence, for when we sketch the image of a paritcular Being in a proposition such as _the pencil is over there_, we have, with words, captured the type (_essence_) of relation embodied by an existent entity that is before us. We have "photographed" Being, reduced its momentary effervescence to a reproducible formulation. 

In light of this, the famous passage from **Genesis** deserves a reinterpretation,

> God mad Man in his image.

As we have just seen, God is, in the Old Testament, defined as the type of Being possessed by the conjugation of _is_ into _am_, the projection of the infinitive into the first person singular. This word, _am_, a literal image in language of our own Being, is, according to the Bible, the very type of Being belonging to God. 


[^5]: Or, it might be more appropriate to say: the Being that is _revealed_ by the I's _am_.
[^6]: Or, should we say: _the formal representation of Being_.
