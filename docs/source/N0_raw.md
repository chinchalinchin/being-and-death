The investigation of the appearance of Death reveals plainly the nature of Life. WHen we witness Death, we see that Life is process and Death is what happens when that ends.

### September 15, 2022

If we pass through the gates of solipsism and finally admit there must be existence outside of ourselves, we might therefore conclude we atleast have attained an uncertain confidence in the validity of our Being.

As proper scientists, we resolves to that aforementioned ballast of cotnradiction. It is an oft misunderstood tenet of statistical reasoning that a hypothesis can be proved true; instead, a hypothesis can only be assumed in order to be shown false. And in this dialectic we will inevitably slip back into the inescapable gravity of Death.

For the nature of science is to hold up a hypothesis and the form of its consequences to the existent and thus determine whether the given data disproves the assumptions by aligning their representative forms to one another and checking for error.

The relations of Being to Deathexpressed in neologistic prepositions:

- Being-not-before
- Being-always-near
- Being-never-here
- Being-always-before-Death
- Being-always-with-Death
- Being-not-in-death

If we now toy with the likely hypothesis that Death is a form of ontological negation, we see only in one of the proposed relations any hint of negation. Upon reflection, the negation in the other forms is hiding.

Death as hiding, or that which is hidden.

**Pessimist**: would could possibly happen?

**Optimist**: the best of all possible worlds.

**Pessimist**: and then what?

We now turn to oen of the most important sections in establishing the validity of the proposed postulates of Death, the Death of the Other.

We start with a question: how do we know we die?

To make the intent of the question more plain, let us recast it: WOuld a human raised in isolation, unexposed to the DEath of the Other, comprehend its own mortality?

The reason Death is oft overlooked as an ontological constatnt is that it is not apparent in the consciousness of Being until the organism has matured to a certain stage. We admit to the difficulty of untangling this problem from its uniquely human characteristics. It is hard to qualify Death as the essential feature of Being because as humans we do not understand it ourselves until a certain age and a certain complexity of thought is reached.

If we supposed Death is essential to Being, we might be lead to the conclusion an infant does not become a Being until they are cognizant of their demises. We point out, by way of aside, that it is curious how our earliest memories only seem to pop up once we reach a threshold determined, in some respect, by the level of our cognitive development. At what point in the emergence of thought, do we become Beings? Isn't the the question really: At what point in Being, do we become Beings that think? How did we start down this path in the first place?

In looking to the animal kingdom, we might be tempted to introduce the jargon of _grades of awareness_. That Beings possess different _levels_ of awarness, and we might posit the ultiamte form of awareness as that awareness which consists of knowedge lof Death. In this way, we might theorize the biological world casts Being into stratas, but this course reeks of absurdity. How can Being be stratified when I only experience things as they are? I do not _shift_ between different ways of Being. I always _am_, despite the manifold changes that operate on me. Are we to suppose the way a dog _is_ is different, that its Being changes as its world changes?

If the author is granted one contribution to the annals of philosophy, let it be the proof of the futility of any future philosophies.

### September 19, 2022

The totality of forms we use to represent the world contains within it a reference to itself.

As if, existence were indicating: you are form to be found in form.

---

Death is what individualizes. If there were no Death, then Being would be eternal. There would be no reason to divide it into _this_ Being and _that_ Being.

---

Consciousness is neither identical to awareness or knowledge.

Consciousness _is not_ the intersection; consciousness is _in_ the intersection.

Philosophy says what is unsaid.

Of course, the un-philosopher says, all I can know is appearance. Why are you saying this? How else could it be otherwise?

To which the philosophy produces four hundred pages to show what is already apparent, but is unsaid, while the un-philosopher retires to enjoy his or her life.

The philosopher, like an ant on a sinking ship, has no notion that the world crumbles around him, no matter how frantically he busies himself with meaningless pursuits.

Committing their original sin, philosophers suppose what can be said is all there is to say on the matter, so to say everything is merely a matter of saying all that can possibly be said. Where philosophy fails is in trying to grapple with those unsaid things that are also unsayable.

Being is a relation. This relation implicitly contains the world and the entity that relates to the world. It is the way in which an existent entity is in the world. Being is with respect to the forms it apprehends, an apprehension of forms that necessarily contains within it the form that is apprehending.

Our Being, and the Being of all other entities, is recursive in this sense. It contains a reference to itself. We are insofar that we can be in relation to ourselves.

**Heidegger** conceptualized this type of Being as `Dasein`, in order to distinguish it from the types of Being possessed by things like plants, rocks, number or concepts. Our Being is such that it is concerned with its Being.

**Heidegger** acknowledges the split between ontology and metaphysics, but nevertheless here implicitly references a metaphysical theorem in the construction of his ontology, namely that the Being of some entites, such as rocks and asteroids, are not concered with Being. Indeed, it seems a likely hypothesis on which to build an ontology: that our Being is distinct from other BEings of a certain species or genre. It is apparent in the world that we, as humans, have unique properties that distinguish us from, say, a park bench. Appearances, however, are no foundation for an ontology. SO that is all it can remain: a hypothesis, a proposition whose truth is to be ascertained empirically, a posteriori. It is, on the contrary, a prior assumption we bring to our ontologies, over and above the ontic priors we implicitly bring with us int our apprehensions, the very priors of which we are trying to discern. IF we build a top a mixture of priors and posteriors, how are to separate the consequences of our assumptions, the consequences of our priors and the variations with respect to one another? If the ontological pursuity is understood as the removal of factical posteriors masquerading as priors from an understanding of our Being, then we must not allow ourselves to be fooled into thinking there is a basis for the differentation of Being into partitions. **Heidegger** means as much when he talks about the _unity_ of Being.

Death is a proposition about form: that it will cease to be.

### September 20, 2022

**Frege**: Do not confuse the `factical` origin of numbers, i.e. abstraction, for the existence of Number.

Number is something that arrives through Being, but is independent of Being, except insofar that it eixsts in the representations of certain Beings. Number is a metaphysical orthogonality in existence, an absolute metric that scales and ascribes to particular existents.

To make the metaphysical nature of Number plain, consider how it is we apprehend five fingers or one hand. The perceptions are coincident, but the conceptions are not. Or, if you prefer **Kantian** language, the appearances overlap, but the phenomena are distinct.

We might say Number is a phenomenon revealed over and above appearance. We might it call _epiphenomenal_, if this term were not loaded with materialistic overtones. Rather, we say it is metaphysical to denote its truth without contingency, whereas _epiphenomenal_ would imply, through syllogism, its dependence on the existent world. 

This signals a missing dimension to **Kant**'s ontology; apperance and phenomena are not identical. In answer to the question: what is NUmber? We reply: metaphysical.

---

**Frege** uncovers an interesting contingency in the logical form in his definitions of the primitive Number. In modern symbolism, he is defining _0_ and _1_ respectively in terms of the cardinality of sets, i.e. in terms of the enumeration of objects,

`A = { @x | x != x } <=> n(A) = 0`

`B = { @x | x = n(A) } <=> n(B) = 1`

Zero is defined as the cardinality of a contradictory set, the so-called _null_ set.. Logic, as it were, has an opinion of itself, namely that its contradictions are empty. This, however, requires the symbolism to express the contradictions that must contain nothing. We have here the trojan horse by which **Russell**'s paradox will subsequently undo the foundations of arithmetic and leave them in ruin until the time of **Zermelo** and **Von Neumann**.

Furthermore, the subsequent form of numbers can be expressed via recursion back to this original proposition about the cardinality of contradictions. Namely, **Frege**'s definition of _1_ is the cardinality of the set whose members equal the cardinality of the _null_ set, i.e. `B = { 0 }`

Take note, the form of the contradiction is irrelevant. We could as well define zero as the cardinality of the negation of the excluded middle, but there is nevertheless an inherent property to any form we substitute into the **Fregean**definition of zero: it contains a circular reference. The relation thus expressed will always involve an expression of _x_ and relation that cannot possibly result in a judgement of truth, in **Frege**'s case the inability of a _thing_ to be itself. The foundation of **Frege**'s arithmetic rests on our ontological apprehension of Nothing as nullity. 

---

In other words, Nothing is a priori to Being. Being is contingent on Nothing (this looks like a tautology, but one must be careful in these things to check your assumptions). In order for this to be the case, negation must also be a prior to Being. 

This is obvious in the realm of formal logic, where only objects of objectified propositions are the operands of asseration or negation, over which existence is quantified, i.e. `A = { #x | x^2 + 1 = 0 }` versus `B = { !#x | x^2 + 1 = 0 }`. In the first case, the quantification implies _x_ is drawn from set of complex numbers and in the second, the quantification of non-existence, implies _x_ must be drawn from the set of real numbers. 

Existence, then, is a metaphysical property that emerges through the interplay of negation, assertion and judgement. All of this tells us nothing of the nature of Being. For that, we turn to **Sartre**.

The form of Being, its representations of the world, tells Being nothing at all about what it means to be except that to be is not to be found in form. And if we ask what it is that separate us (in the mode of Being) from oursevles (in the mode of Being form), the only possibility is Nothing. Thus, Nothing, negation and existence are the metaphysical foundation of Being, the a prioris of ontology. 

This is what we mean we say that _being is not identical to existence_.

Language has an interest property that appears at first to arise through its historicality, but upon refelction is more fundamental then its apparent contingency implies. 

If Death happens to all Beings, then there is no definite beginning to language. It is always something that was invented in the past, for its possibility presupposes its existence.

To see this, we first recognize language as contingent on the possibility of the Other, if not the quantified existence of the Other. For language presupposes there is someone with which to converse.

Before a form is recognized as an existent concept, it is first apprehended through phenomena as object, in terms of its appearance in time and space. In order to converse with the Other, we must first comprehend in our appearances the commonality of form we share in our Being, so that we might establish a reference to one another, i.e. an indicative form, or in **Fregean** langauge, a signifer, a `sinn`. The possibiility of language is contained in the Being of the Other, and it is only through the Other that Being is said to communicate. 

So, returning to our isolated human raised in all white room from the moment of birth, if the infant cannot sustain itself without the intervention of the Other to show it what to do, even if the infant were brought int oexistence next to a pile of food and water, then language is an essential condition of Being. By language here, we mean the ability to understand through representative form the meaning of the Other's action in the world.

All of this must preced the formation of language, and therefore the history of language.

Appearance versus phenomenon.

Object versus concept.

### September 21, 2022

The concept is an abstraction on top of the phenomenon, i.e. the "moons of Earth" is an abstraction over the correspondence in our sense impression of reflected light falling on the retina. The appearance in our perception is not the concept, it is _gestalt_. Upon conceptualization, it makes ingress into the metaphysical. It is there where we can make assertions, such as P = _one belongs to the concept "moons of Earth"_ versus Q = _four belonGs to the concept "moons of Jupiter"_. That these assertions refer to somethign that exists in our Being is incidental to their form. Truth is the descent from the metaphysical into the physical, or if your prefer, the ascent of the physical into the metaphysical; the whole process one of _transcedence_. The metaphysical assertions _P_ becomes physical with respect to existence. It is only metaphysical in the sense that it is conceivable to suppose that _P_ were not the case, i.e. a world where Earth has two moons. Truth, or more generally, assertion is the bridge between metaphysical and physical, between the possibilty of form and its existing. Physical is a synonym of existential, i.e. of existence.

**Heidegger**'s blindspot was not realizing our ontological nature, our way of Being in the world, is inherently metaphysical. We find ourselves BEing in the world, with an inherent interpretation of that Being as a Being in the world. We have assumed a metaphysical postture simply by Being here, not there; this, not that. Our very BEing is a metaphysical assertion that this is the way it is and not some other way. It is by Being and through Being that metaphysics becomes physics, if by physics we understand what is actual rather than the inquiry of physics. 

**Whitehead** remarked on this. In a way, our field of inquiry cannot help but be metaphysics. If we tak the sum total of physical law as a collective assertion and try from this premise to deduce hwo it is we come to be as phenomenal Beings, judging its ultimate validity in its ability to make clear why Being is just so, we must necessarily assign to the proposition thus formed a value of false. Our understanding of Being can never be Being, because we msut first be in order to know.

Existence as the denial of the negated universal.

A universal is something whose truth obtains without reference to existence, without circumstance or contingency. It is always true, regardless of the particular state of things. It will, for instance, always be the case `A = A`, or that some symbols will fill the place of equivalence in whatever language chosen. 

(Is equivalence implicit in language?)

The negation of the universal, owing to the mutual exclusivity of truth and falsity, is then something which is always false, regardless of the particular state of thigns.

To deny the negation of a universal proposition is then equivalent to asserting the existence of at least one instance of its truth. For it atleast one instance is to be found, the negation of the universal cannot be the case.

**Frege** went to great lenghts to show the _sense_ of a proposition was separate from its _meaning_. Its _sense_ is an artifact of its form. So we say `x^2 + 2` has a different sense, i.e. form, than `x ( x + 1)` while retaining the same meaning, that is a range of numbers whose square is increase by two, i.e. a concept. 

This is the first formulation of the `axiom of extensionality`, the idea from set theory that if two _concepts_ have the same elements, then those two concepts are equivalent, regardless of how the concepts are defined. 

Consider:

1. The man born from virgin birth.
2. The man who died for our sins.

In both cases, the solution is the same, namely Jesus Christ. Therefore, the sets defined by these propositions are equivalent.

The concept, the range denoted, is irrespective of the form it assumes, i.e. its appearance. Propositions involving one form may have that form substituted with its equivalent appearance without affecting the overall _meaning_ of the proposition.

Where the propsition becomes actual is when the concept bound in the propositional form is asserted to exist or not exist, indepdent of form, its form being incidental to its truth value, as the `axiom of extensionality` shows. 

Here metaphysics intersects with onotlogy, for we have given form to the metaphysical content prior to Being. Thus, we may approach it and find oursevles in the world with it. Our interpretaion of our Being in the world necessarily influences our comprehension of the principels we use to understand the world. The fact that metaphysics can be a Being we encounter means it msut necessarily turn on itself and exaime its own foundation through own Being, for we can make it the obejct of inquiry, that inquiry being the existence that transcends metaphysics into actuality.

`Vis a vis **Frege** second order concept. Concept of all concepts necessarily contains a reference to itself, i.e. it is a concept that contains itself. 

Is this not the same type of relation that **Heidegger** defines as `Dasein`? How is it different? 

**Heidegger**'s `Dasein` is a Being which by Being is concerned with Being. If that BEing considers the BEing of all Beings, it necessarily brings into Being a Being that contains itself. This is exactly the limit of **Frege**'s second order concept. 

But it is subtler than that. `Dasein` by Being in any way always approaches Being in a particular way, with a particular interpretation of its Being with respect to the world that unde`rstands it is Being amidst Beings. The `Dasein` is such that it always contains itself.

**Cantor**'s diagonalization.

Here then is the ontological horror dressed in mathematics: either a contradiction exists or it doesn't. If it does, then so do we. If it doesn't, then neither do we. If it does, then DEath is that by which Nothing comes to Being. If it doesn't, then we are Nothing in the first place and it only Death that makes consistent.

**Heidegger** identifies anxiety as that which gives rise to Nothing.

Anxiety: when your own Being is your only concern.

The author posits it is Nothing that gives gives to the anxiety of Being. Consider, dear reader, the proposition that your Being, as Being in the here and now, is Nothing at all.

There is only one mode of Being which seeks NOthing and that is suicide. Authentic suicide, by which we mean suicide that seesk to not be, as opposed to suicide that seeks Being in death, as in the case of a solider who charges headfirst into battle in order to die a hero, the symbol of the hero Being what persists after his Death. This is not authentic suicide. Authentic suicide is what happens when a Being is so distraught and anxious by Being that it seeks to no longer be, i.e. Being in order to not be. 

It is in this authentic way of Being towards suicide that we are able to glimpse, at least tangentially, the true nature of Death. The Being of suicide is anguish and despair, when one has been torn from the world and all that remains is the pain inside, not the pain of the nervous system, but the raw and primordial pain of Being whose meaning can onyl be captured in prose, where the form breaks down and stands for nothing but pure and utter desolation.
