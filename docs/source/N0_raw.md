The investigation of the appearance of Death reveals plainly the nature of Life. WHen we witness Death, we see that Life is process and Death is what happens when that ends.

### September 15, 2022

If we pass through the gates of solipsism and finally admit there must be existence outside of ourselves, we might therefore conclude we atleast have attained an uncertain confidence in the validity of our Being.

But confidence in a probability is not the same as knowledge of truth. It is curiosity of science that is not, properly speaking, concerned with truth. Science, in its wisdom, realizes truth can never be stated as fact. Rather, the only thing that can be said is what is not the case. As proper scientists, we can only approach truth asymptotically, by showing the outline of what is through what it is not. It is an oft misunderstood tenet of statistical reasoning that a hypothesis can be proved true; instead, a hypothesis can only be assumed in order to be shown false. And in this dialectic we will inevitably slip back into the inescapable gravity of uncertainty.

For the nature of science is to hold up a hypothesis and the form of its consequences to the existent and thus determine whether the given data disproves the assumptions by aligning their representative forms to one another and checking for error.

The relations of Being to Death expressed in neologistic prepositions:

- Being-always-near
- Being-never-here
- Being-always-before
- Being-always
- Being-not-in

If we now toy with the likely hypothesis that Death is a form of ontological negation, we see only in some of the proposed relations any hint of negation. Upon reflection, the negation in the other forms is hiding.

Death as hiding, or that which is hidden.

**Pessimist**: would could possibly happen?

**Optimist**: the best of all possible worlds.

**Pessimist**: and then what?

### September 18, 2022

We now turn to oen of the most important sections in establishing the validity of the proposed postulates of Death, the Death of the Other.

We start with a question: how do we know we die?

To make the intent of the question more plain, let us recast it: WOuld a human raised in isolation, unexposed to the DEath of the Other, comprehend its own mortality?

The reason Death is oft overlooked as an ontological constatnt is that it is not apparent in the consciousness of Being until the organism has matured to a certain stage. We admit to the difficulty of untangling this problem from its uniquely human characteristics. It is hard to qualify Death as the essential feature of Being because as humans we do not understand it ourselves until a certain age and a certain complexity of thought is reached.

If we supposed Death is essential to Being, we might be lead to the conclusion an infant does not become a Being until they are cognizant of their demises. We point out, by way of aside, that it is curious how our earliest memories only seem to pop up once we reach a threshold determined, in some respect, by the level of our cognitive development. At what point in the emergence of thought, do we become Beings? Isn't the the question really: At what point in Being, do we become Beings that think? How did we start down this path in the first place?

In looking to the animal kingdom, we might be tempted to introduce the jargon of _grades of awareness_. That Beings possess different _levels_ of awarness, and we might posit the ultiamte form of awareness as that awareness which consists of knowedge lof Death. In this way, we might theorize the biological world casts Being into stratas, but this course reeks of absurdity. How can Being be stratified when I only experience things as they are? I do not _shift_ between different ways of Being. I always _am_, despite the manifold changes that operate on me. Are we to suppose the way a dog _is_ is different, that its Being changes as its world changes?

If the author is granted one contribution to the annals of philosophy, let it be the proof of the futility of any future philosophies.

### September 19, 2022

The totality of forms we use to represent the world contains within it a reference to itself.

As if, existence were indicating: you are form to be found in form.

---

Death is what individualizes. If there were no Death, then Being would be eternal. There would be no reason to divide it into _this_ Being and _that_ Being.

---

Consciousness is neither identical to awareness or knowledge.

Consciousness _is not_ the intersection; consciousness is _in_ the intersection.

Philosophy says what is unsaid.

Of course, the un-philosopher says, all I can know is appearance. Why are you saying this? How else could it be otherwise?

To which the philosophy produces four hundred pages to show what is already apparent, but is unsaid, while the un-philosopher retires to enjoy his or her life.

The philosopher, like an ant on a sinking ship, has no notion that the world crumbles around him, no matter how frantically he busies himself with meaningless pursuits.

Committing their original sin, philosophers suppose what can be said is all there is to say on the matter, so to say everything is merely a matter of saying all that can possibly be said. Where philosophy fails is in trying to grapple with those unsaid things that are also unsayable.

Being is a relation. This relation implicitly contains the world and the entity that relates to the world. It is the way in which an existent entity is in the world. Being is with respect to the forms it apprehends, an apprehension of forms that necessarily contains within it the form that is apprehending.

Our Being, and the Being of all other entities, is recursive in this sense. It contains a reference to itself. We are insofar that we can be in relation to ourselves.

**Heidegger** conceptualized this type of Being as `Dasein`, in order to distinguish it from the types of Being possessed by things like plants, rocks, number or concepts. Our Being is such that it is concerned with its Being.

**Heidegger** acknowledges the split between ontology and metaphysics, but nevertheless here implicitly references a metaphysical theorem in the construction of his ontology, namely that the Being of some entites, such as rocks and asteroids, are not concered with Being. Indeed, it seems a likely hypothesis on which to build an ontology: that our Being is distinct from other BEings of a certain species or genre. It is apparent in the world that we, as humans, have unique properties that distinguish us from, say, a park bench. Appearances, however, are no foundation for an ontology. SO that is all it can remain: a hypothesis, a proposition whose truth is to be ascertained empirically, a posteriori. It is, on the contrary, a prior assumption we bring to our ontologies, over and above the ontic priors we implicitly bring with us int our apprehensions, the very priors of which we are trying to discern. IF we build a top a mixture of priors and posteriors, how are to separate the consequences of our assumptions, the consequences of our priors and the variations with respect to one another? If the ontological pursuity is understood as the removal of factical posteriors masquerading as priors from an understanding of our Being, then we must not allow ourselves to be fooled into thinking there is a basis for the differentation of Being into partitions. **Heidegger** means as much when he talks about the _unity_ of Being.

Death is a proposition about form: that it will cease to be.

### September 20, 2022

**Frege**: Do not confuse the `factical` origin of numbers, i.e. abstraction, for the existence of Number.

Number is something that arrives through Being, but is independent of Being, except insofar that it eixsts in the representations of certain Beings. Number is a metaphysical orthogonality in existence, an absolute metric that scales and ascribes to particular existents.

To make the metaphysical nature of Number plain, consider how it is we apprehend five fingers or one hand. The perceptions are coincident, but the conceptions are not. Or, if you prefer **Kantian** language, the appearances overlap, but the phenomena are distinct.

We might say Number is a phenomenon revealed over and above appearance. We might it call _epiphenomenal_, if this term were not loaded with materialistic overtones. Rather, we say it is metaphysical to denote its truth without contingency, whereas _epiphenomenal_ would imply, through syllogism, its dependence on the existent world. 

This signals a missing dimension to **Kant**'s ontology; apperance and phenomena are not identical. In answer to the question: what is NUmber? We reply: metaphysical.

---

**Frege** uncovers an interesting contingency in the logical form in his definitions of the primitive Number. In modern symbolism, he is defining _0_ and _1_ respectively in terms of the cardinality of sets, i.e. in terms of the enumeration of objects,

`A = { @x | x != x } <=> n(A) = 0`

`B = { @x | x = n(A) } <=> n(B) = 1`

Zero is defined as the cardinality of a contradictory set, the so-called _null_ set.. Logic, as it were, has an opinion of itself, namely that its contradictions are empty. This, however, requires the symbolism to express the contradictions that must contain nothing. We have here the trojan horse by which **Russell**'s paradox will subsequently undo the foundations of arithmetic and leave them in ruin until the time of **Zermelo** and **Von Neumann**.

Furthermore, the subsequent form of numbers can be expressed via recursion back to this original proposition about the cardinality of contradictions. Namely, **Frege**'s definition of _1_ is the cardinality of the set whose members equal the cardinality of the _null_ set, i.e. `B = { 0 }`

Take note, the form of the contradiction is irrelevant. We could as well define zero as the cardinality of the negation of the excluded middle, but there is nevertheless an inherent property to any form we substitute into the **Fregean**definition of zero: it contains a circular reference. The relation thus expressed will always involve an expression of _x_ and relation that cannot possibly result in a judgement of truth, in **Frege**'s case the inability of a _thing_ to be itself. The foundation of **Frege**'s arithmetic rests on our ontological apprehension of Nothing as nullity. 

---

In other words, Nothing is a priori to Being. Being is contingent on Nothing (this looks like a tautology, but one must be careful in these things to check your assumptions). In order for this to be the case, negation must also be a prior to Being. 

This is obvious in the realm of formal logic, where only objects of objectified propositions are the operands of asseration or negation, over which existence is quantified, i.e. `A = { #x | x^2 + 1 = 0 }` versus `B = { !#x | x^2 + 1 = 0 }`. In the first case, the quantification implies _x_ is drawn from set of complex numbers and in the second, the quantification of non-existence, implies _x_ must be drawn from the set of real numbers. 

Existence, then, is a metaphysical property that emerges through the interplay of negation, assertion and judgement. All of this tells us nothing of the nature of Being. For that, we turn to **Sartre**.

The form of Being, its representations of the world, tells Being nothing at all about what it means to be except that to be is not to be found in form. And if we ask what it is that separate us (in the mode of Being) from oursevles (in the mode of Being form), the only possibility is Nothing. Thus, Nothing, negation and existence are the metaphysical foundation of Being, the a prioris of ontology. 

This is what we mean we say that _being is not identical to existence_.

---

Language has an interest property that appears at first to arise through its historicality, but upon refelction is more fundamental then its apparent contingency implies. 

If Death happens to all Beings, then there is no definite beginning to language. It is always something that was invented in the past, for its possibility presupposes its existence.

To see this, we first recognize language as contingent on the possibility of the Other, if not the quantified existence of the Other. For language presupposes there is someone with which to converse.

Before a form is recognized as an existent concept, it is first apprehended through phenomena as object, in terms of its appearance in time and space. In order to converse with the Other, we must first comprehend in our appearances the commonality of form we share in our Being, so that we might establish a reference to one another, i.e. an indicative form, or in **Fregean** langauge, a signifer, a `sinn`. The possibiility of language is contained in the Being of the Other, and it is only through the Other that Being is said to communicate. 

So, returning to our isolated human raised in all white room from the moment of birth, if the infant cannot sustain itself without the intervention of the Other to show it what to do, even if the infant were brought int oexistence next to a pile of food and water, then language is an essential condition of Being. By language here, we mean the ability to understand through representative form the meaning of the Other's action in the world.

All of this must preced the formation of language, and therefore the history of language.

Appearance versus phenomenon.

Object versus concept.

### September 21, 2022

The concept is an abstraction on top of the phenomenon, i.e. the "moons of Earth" is an abstraction over the correspondence in our sense impression of reflected light falling on the retina. The appearance in our perception is not the concept, it is _gestalt_. Upon conceptualization, it makes ingress into the metaphysical. It is there where we can make assertions, such as P = _one belongs to the concept "moons of Earth"_ versus Q = _four belonGs to the concept "moons of Jupiter"_. That these assertions refer to somethign that exists in our Being is incidental to their form. Truth is the descent from the metaphysical into the physical, or if your prefer, the ascent of the physical into the metaphysical; the whole process one of _transcedence_. The metaphysical assertions _P_ becomes physical with respect to existence. It is only metaphysical in the sense that it is conceivable to suppose that _P_ were not the case, i.e. a world where Earth has two moons. Truth, or more generally, assertion is the bridge between metaphysical and physical, between the possibilty of form and its existing. Physical is a synonym of existential, i.e. of existence.

**Heidegger**'s blindspot was not realizing our ontological nature, our way of Being in the world, is inherently metaphysical. We find ourselves BEing in the world, with an inherent interpretation of that Being as a Being in the world. We have assumed a metaphysical postture simply by Being here, not there; this, not that. Our very BEing is a metaphysical assertion that this is the way it is and not some other way. It is by Being and through Being that metaphysics becomes physics, if by physics we understand what is actual rather than the inquiry of physics. 

**Whitehead** remarked on this. In a way, our field of inquiry cannot help but be metaphysics. If we tak the sum total of physical law as a collective assertion and try from this premise to deduce hwo it is we come to be as phenomenal Beings, judging its ultimate validity in its ability to make clear why Being is just so, we must necessarily assign to the proposition thus formed a value of false. Our understanding of Being can never be Being, because we msut first be in order to know.

Existence as the denial of the negated universal.

A universal is something whose truth obtains without reference to existence, without circumstance or contingency. It is always true, regardless of the particular state of things. It will, for instance, always be the case `A = A`, or that some symbols will fill the place of equivalence in whatever language chosen. 

(Is equivalence implicit in language?)

The negation of the universal, owing to the mutual exclusivity of truth and falsity, is then something which is always false, regardless of the particular state of thigns.

To deny the negation of a universal proposition is then equivalent to asserting the existence of at least one instance of its truth. For it atleast one instance is to be found, the negation of the universal cannot be the case.

**Frege** went to great lenghts to show the _sense_ of a proposition was separate from its _meaning_. Its _sense_ is an artifact of its form. So we say `x^2 + 2` has a different sense, i.e. form, than `x ( x + 1)` while retaining the same meaning, that is a range of numbers whose square is increase by two, i.e. a concept. 

This is the first formulation of the `axiom of extensionality`, the idea from set theory that if two _concepts_ have the same elements, then those two concepts are equivalent, regardless of how the concepts are defined. 

Consider:

1. The man born from virgin birth.
2. The man who died for our sins.

In both cases, the solution is the same, namely Jesus Christ. Therefore, the sets defined by these propositions are equivalent.

The concept, the range denoted, is irrespective of the form it assumes, i.e. its appearance. Propositions involving one form may have that form substituted with its equivalent appearance without affecting the overall _meaning_ of the proposition.

Where the propsition becomes actual is when the concept bound in the propositional form is asserted to exist or not exist, indepdent of form, its form being incidental to its truth value, as the `axiom of extensionality` shows. 

Here metaphysics intersects with onotlogy, for we have given form to the metaphysical content prior to Being. Thus, we may approach it and find oursevles in the world with it. Our interpretaion of our Being in the world necessarily influences our comprehension of the principels we use to understand the world. The fact that metaphysics can be a Being we encounter means it msut necessarily turn on itself and exaime its own foundation through own Being, for we can make it the obejct of inquiry, that inquiry being the existence that transcends metaphysics into actuality.

---

`Vis a vis **Frege** second order concept. Concept of all concepts necessarily contains a reference to itself, i.e. it is a concept that contains itself. 

Is this not the same type of relation that **Heidegger** defines as `Dasein`? How is it different? 

**Heidegger**'s `Dasein` is a Being which by Being is concerned with Being. If that BEing considers the BEing of all Beings, it necessarily brings into Being a Being that contains itself. This is exactly the limit of **Frege**'s second order concept. 

But it is subtler than that. `Dasein` by Being in any way always approaches Being in a particular way, with a particular interpretation of its Being with respect to the world that unde`rstands it is Being amidst Beings. The `Dasein` is such that it always contains itself.

**Cantor**'s diagonalization.

Here then is the ontological horror dressed in mathematics: either a contradiction exists or it doesn't. If it does, then so do we. If it doesn't, then neither do we. If it does, then DEath is that by which Nothing comes to Being. If it doesn't, then we are Nothing in the first place and it only Death that makes consistent.

---

**Heidegger** identifies anxiety as that which gives rise to Nothing.

Anxiety: when your own Being is your only concern.

The author posits it is Nothing that gives gives to the anxiety of Being. Consider, dear reader, the proposition that your Being, as Being in the here and now, is Nothing at all.

There is only one mode of Being which seeks NOthing and that is suicide. Authentic suicide, by which we mean suicide that seesk to not be, as opposed to suicide that seeks Being in death, as in the case of a solider who charges headfirst into battle in order to die a hero, the symbol of the hero Being what persists after his Death. This is not authentic suicide. Authentic suicide is what happens when a Being is so distraught and anxious by Being that it seeks to no longer be, i.e. Being in order to not be. 

It is in this authentic way of Being towards suicide that we are able to glimpse, at least tangentially, the true nature of Death. The Being of suicide is anguish and despair, when one has been torn from the world and all that remains is the pain inside, not the pain of the nervous system, but the raw and primordial pain of Being whose meaning can onyl be captured in prose, where the form breaks down and stands for nothing but pure and utter desolation.

---

The great project of rationalism is reducing everything to logic so tthat all that is, was and ever will be is reducible to form and the rules that govern the transition of forms.

The proof of the falsity of this is simple. _I_ have an opinion about rationalism and that BEing towards it induces a phenomenal experience. 

Nonsense, say the rationlsits. Your phenomenal apprehension can be reduced to biology and then to chemistry and then to physics and then to mathematics. This we grant, but with the caveat we be shown where in the forms we use to express this knowledge we can find what it is that tells us how it is we are to feel to about rationalism.

Well, the light falling on the retina excites the optic never, which delivers information to the brain and the brain maps the sense into overlapping neural networks which induce an efferent reaction that is carried back down through the nervous system resulting in action.

Why, then, do we feel such revulsion at this description? Where can that be found in the description?

To put it another way and cast it into a modern understnading, are we to suppose that in addition to Being able to program the conditions for artifical consciousness to become a Being that, by employing the principles used to bring about its conditions, we will thereby be able to chart its course through Being? That its Being will be mere form, a set of instructions from which the turmoil of Being arises?

Where in this algorithm is the procedure for suicide? What set of steps produce the motivation to end one's Being for the sake of Nothing?

Where are the conditions for suicide to be found if not in Being, i.e. in Being depressed, in Being anxious, in Being sorrowful, in Being guilty, etc. No matter what form you present, you will never present a method by which that form  can become the heart-rending anguish of Being suicidal, unless that form is in the world, where the possibility of Being Other resides, where I can understand the Other through my own Being towards suicide.

But we already knew logic was incomplete.

### September 22, 2022

Nullity is of the same nature as cardinality. Nothing, however, is a subtler notion by far. 

--- 

Assertion is the glue which bings propositions to Reality, the Being of existence. 

Is equality a form of assertion? Does not the statement `x(x+1) = x^2 + x` assert something about form itself, i.e. that both sides may _stand for_ or _announce themselves in place of_ what they represent. Here is what **Heidegger** meant by _announcing_; _announcing_ reveals that which what announces is not.

**Heidegger**'s _announcing_ as the ontological statement of the `axiom of extensionality`. _Announcing_ as ontological substitution.

### September 24, 2022

Oh, **Schopenhauer**, so close, just a little further. If all objects come to Being through the principle of sufficient reason and are nothing but that, and I recognize myself as an object among objects, what use is _Will_?

What happens when the last person dies? When the last subject perishes from this world we share? IF time and space are nothing but mere representational form, what happens when there is no more subject to presuppose it?

Nothing, dear **Schopenhauer**. Nothing at all.

Language is a historical artifat hiding in plain sight. It is the result of humans coming to be and finding themselves in the world with Others like them. Every word we use to express a thought was claimed after a great primordial struggle that will forever and always remain in the fog of history.

It is an interesting question whether or not this feature of linguistic history is unique to human language or is indeed an ontological property. That a child is not born with language, but acquires it, suggests it is not a direct consequence of genetics; rather, it suggests language is only a possibilty derivative of some other phenomenon, something that need not have occured, at least through the contingency of biology alone, but did, as evidenced by these words.

If we assumed language is not a mere accident of human history but is rather an ontological property of our Being, i.e. the Being of `Dasein`, then it must be the case that every drop of language was drawn from the well of intellect after long droughts of silence and stagnation, after epic struggles against nameless chaos and confusion.

Then, the complexity of our langage speaks to the long history of humanity, tens of thousands of years, if not hundreds of thousands, eons before Plato and Aristotle ever dream of the question of BEing, already our `ontic` awareness, our Being present, was mapping out the relations that binded us to the world through its attempt to commune with the Other, who likewise found themselves in the world with no spoken language yet. Language acquisition for any society of self-aware BEings must necessarily be a hard fought process, where the multiplicitious power of the intellect discovers the form of the Other.

(This can be seen in the account by **Chesselden** of a boy born blind who, when given sight through an operation to remove cataracts, discovered concepts like distance and spatiality were not self-evident, but had to be acquired through the power of the intellect. This involved a period of the teenaged boy not understanding how to differentiate objects through sight alone and even when this was understood, asking questions like "_which sense is the liar? sight or hearing?" when he discovered the people he loved were not necessarily beautiful or pleasing to the eye.)

It is only, then, within recent history, the last three or four thousand years, when the relations mapped out by the necessity of uncertainty, of intellects cautiously testing the limits of what symbols could represent and intimate, that we began to ask what it is these words that arose through mindless (but not indeterminate) history actually meant. When the Greeks first asked what it meant to be, humanity had already tacitly been using these words, with an intuitive, but not clarified, understanding of what they meant, in non-reflective sense, where meaning is inherent In the situtation and not subject to inquiry. It had never occured, and still never occurs to most, these words we use might mean something, their very form might be evidence of our primitive aspect, the heraldry of our ontological lineage. We are bound through the factical emergence of history to the very first Being who ever spoke, or atleast the very first Being who spoke the ancestor of our language, iif we are careful not to overlook the possibilty of language evolving multiple times, concurrently even.

Here we see what we mean by `ontic` versus `reflective` consciousness. `Ontic` awareness is what revealed language as a form, generated by our action, capable of affecting the world through the action of the Other. THe meaning of the words, insofar that we mean their conceptualization in the intellect, is what is revealed in `reflective` consciousness. In short:

`Ontic` consciousness: I am.

`Reflective` consciounsness: I am?

### September 26, 2022

As if the truth and meaning of the logical process only entered into the question after we had come to use it in our daily lives.

This, in and of itself, should give lie to the rationalist project of the reduction of consciousness to formulae. There is a crucial element missing in all modern inquiries into its nature: that Being precedes consciousness. In this, **Descartes** put the horse before the cart. He should rather have said: _I am_ and then _I think_. The formulation of _cogito ergo sum_ implies a dependence of the consequent on the antecedent, when in actuality there is no reason to assume this is the case. My Being is separate from my thinking, and we should be careful in our analysis to highlight this differentiation. THat I think is contingent on my Being, but does not neccesarrily follow from my Being. I am because I feel, because I perceive myself in the world. Whether or not the world obtains existence with or without my consent is irrelevant. Being requires a world in order to become.

It is conceivable to imagine a lifeform with a life span of millenia and a gestation period of a few months, say. With this type of life, we may atleast enertain the possibility of a concurrent development of language and history, but even with such absurdities the necessity of langague running before history is apparent. History is a derivative of language, for it is expressed through language, to say nothing at all about the possible contingency of memory of language. How much of our memory is predicated on our ability to communicate, not only with the Other, but with ourselves? Doesn't this, in and of itself, prove the Other's Being is equivalent to my Being? Do we recognize ourselv as Other before communication is ontologically possible or do we recognize communication prior to the Other? Or yet another possibility: are the Other and communication somehow different manifestations of some essential term? Or are they mutually exclusive, orthogonal concepts that span a new space? THese are questions I am not sure philosophy has even begun to ask. 

If we allow ourselves to engage in speculative philosophy, we should give serious thought to the proposition that language is a mode of our Being, baked into it from the very start. If the Other is given as possibility hidden behind every objectification, then the primary, or atleast one of the primary, relations that binds our BEing to that of the Other is uncertainty, an ontological uncertainty which possesses everything at all time and supposes a presence to the Other, even in an empty room. Especially in an empty room.

Language, under this assumption, would be predicated on a kind of guessing game, where the Other dimensionalizes an otherwise static BEing across a space of possibilty. No longer is the form we perceive inanimate, but contains the possibility of meaning somethign beyond its immediate appearance. IF we ask how it is we are to know one object is Other and one is not, i.e. how the animate is distinguished from the inanimate, we must admint, thought we have criteria we apply that ensures success with high probability, i.e. language and the ability to communicate, there is no absolute standard by which we make this judgement. The possibility of the Other is everywhere. You cannot say with 100% certainty the chair you are sitting on as you read this is not aware that you are sitting on it.

This would explain the common believe in primitive people that attributes consciousness to natural phenomena like rain, wind, etc. Our Being is such that it seeks to find Others liek it; we impose on the world a shadow world of the Other, where all events might have their explanation through the motives of an unknowable Being, i.e. the Other.

Isn't this the basis of God? That all things are explained through divine motives? **Carl Jung** often talked about humanity's instinct for religion. Under the considered hypothesis, this instinct is seen, not as a biological contingency, but an ontological contingency. 

---

Claim: Meaning is the essential mode of Being.

Meaning is expressed through form and comprehended in thought. THe Other is essentially form, but a form that contains the unique possibility of meaning something Other than what it is.

We see the primitive implementations of this ontological truth in lower forms of biology. A tree is a thing, almost as clsoe as nature provides to the inanimate in the animal kingdom, but it is not entirely itself, for it grows and changes forms; but in this changing it maintain identity. In order for a form that is spatially and temporally distinct to maintain identity, there must be some Other dimension by which to quantify its sameness, some space-time projection through a single point in the partitioned hyperplane of concepts. The tree is not juyst what it is, i.e. hardness, color, orientation, etc., but something over and above, a `beudeutung`.

When we then turn to the other extreme, we see the range of phenomena thus encompassed: the Other that hides in human skin.

### September 27, 2022

Can a Being come to be with a fully formed set of memories? This idea is a common top in science fiction, particularly loved by the likes of **Philip K. Dick**, but to what extent is it applicable to reality?

From a certain perspective, the answer to this equestion must always be _yes_, for each moment (concrescence) of our lives is a new becoming that points back to all the previous becomings that led to it, i.e. it's `factical` trajectory, its contingency. SO each moment we find oursevles Being with memories of having been that only exist here and now insofar that they represent here and now what Being we were before.

But in this train of thought, we have presupposed our memories are _real_, that each recollection points back to a definite moment, excepting vagaries of data loss. Is it possible for a Being to come to be with a false set of memories? 

How would we go about cerating an artifical intellgence that believed it was **Pablo Picasso** or **Leonardo Da Vinci**? Implant false memories, replies science fiction, as if this process of "_implanting_" were static and not a process that need unwind through time. We tacitly assume memory is something that can be substituted into place and replaced at will with somethign else, led to this conclusion by the generalizing gaze of rationalization that reduces everything to substitutable quantities. Perhaps this is the case, but until we know for sure, we must also entertain the possibility that in order for an artifical intelligence to acquire "_false_" memories, it must do so through the mechanism of phenomenal experience. ANd if this is the case, we cannot assume the process is deterministic, i.e. if we could faithfully replicate the exact history of external stimuli impinging upon **Picasso**'s sense organs, it does not necessarily follow the AI would be a one-to-one map with the Being that was **Picasso** in our world history timeline. 

To go even further, what would it entail creating an artifical intelligence that believed space had five dimensions, time was bidirectional and causality was such that what comes after conditions what came before (or that chronology were not a relation at all, say)? Is such a formulation possible? Have we violated an ontological principle in conducting this thought experiment? If so, what _is_ that error we have committed?

### October 3, 2022

There is in the contintental philosophy camp a curious detachment from the subject they purport to study. The phenomenology they describe, in hewing to formalism and clarification, seems to miss the point. 

Yes, the world is, in some resposne, a totality of references, a horizon of possible happenigns; it is a constellation of particularized eidetic generalites, a concrescence of actual entities into novelty, all of these attempt to elucidate what is already appareant when we lift our eyes from the page and listen:

In the pitch black of night, as looming shadows of what might be sentinel pines block out the fingers of the moon, and what might be crickets chirp in the ether, in those solmen moments, when a primal howl shrieks and shatters the quiet, there is Nothing left but the moment of pure terror and apprehension, of the blatant gravity of existence drawing us in into our bodies, making us inhabit our presence fully and without reflection, without consideration of bank accounts or property regulations or tax codes, when the rawness of Being is just this: live or die.

That is when the world is "_lit_" up in its totality, when all imagined knowledge is condensed down into the impulses of survival, when we reach for the flashlight and find it gone, when we stumble through the dark and realize we are lost, when the baying of an unnatural monster nips at our heels and we snatch at anything we might use to beat _it_ back.

We see in this struggle the essential nature of Being and how it arises throug htis perpetual flight in front of Death: we discover equipment "_ready-to-hand_" in its most primordial sense: that of a weapon.

Why does **Heidegger** shy away from this truth? All equipment is in essence a weapon, and it is used to fight Death. The simplest tool, a blunt object, what is its use if not to hit? To maim? To kill? And what use is the hammer, if not to build a barrier between you and Death? All equipment is preceded ontologically by Death. All of it, without exception. Even the distractions, the make up and video games and art, it is simply to posit existence independent of Death: _I can be fashionable_, _I can have a legacy_, _I can ignore my mortality thereby surpassing Death in some capacity_. 

In the raw struggle against Death, there is no pretense of philosophy. You do not question your knowledge. If you are wrong, then you die and there is no one left to question anything. Being is perpetual trial by fire. In the face of Death, Being stands out exactly as it is: a means to escape Death. Every dimension of Being twists towards averting it: clutched handfuls of dirth become handholds on a ladder "_in-order-to_" to tear yourselv away from the jaws of a predator, rocks become projectiles (and so we see our "_synthetic_" notion of _bodies are heavy_ is not at all "_synthetic")

(Is this true? Does the man in mortal terror use tools? Can things in the immediacy of experience be _tools_?)

What do three rocks and the concept three have in common? Their form, **Schopenhauer** answers. But form in this sense implies something other than a physical thing, though that is one aspect of its implication; it implies a relationship between the parts, where the parts have been substracted and replaced with indeterminate unities.

Anything can be a symbol for anything else. Interpretation is infinite, **Cantor**'s absolute infinity, that exceeds all enumeration. It is merely a matter of assigning the rules of construction. We can, for instance, interpret the symbol _3_ to stand for the notion _all things must die_ if we conceive of a system where the curvature of the stroke in each branch of _3_ represents different parts of the _form_ of the thought, i.e. quantification, nouns, verbs, etc.

The form of an object is a reflection of the physical thing in the sense; it is a basis by which the `noumena` is projected into the `phenomena`, a one-to-many relation made manifest in the unending possibility of its Being. 

---

This is why we enjoy ironic and metaphorical literature: it is a coincidence of dimensions, a folding of reality that reveals its unity in a new way; when we realize the hero in _For Whom The Bells Toll_ ends the story where he started, when we realize the blinking light in the _Great Gatsby_ represents the unattainable ideal, when we realize, like a Matroska dool, that the part stands for the whole, when the meaning of things is laid parallel to the thing themselves and reveals itself as a thing among other things, this is when we derivbe the greatest pleasure from literature, bcause this is the essential mode of Being, that of _concrescence_, the perpetual manifestation of novelty.

_res extensa_, _res cogito_ versus _res solus_?

---

There is a split between existence and Being. What is it that separates them?

Being passes away. A thing does not pass from existence, for existence is a fact, which becomes history through Being, and facts are things which are the case. We do say the curve does not exist because its limit as its dependent becomes infinite goes to zero. Likewise we say the thing longer is, not that it never was.

--- 

Either we admit existence is indepenent of the things which exist, or else we admit the existence of things is numerical in terms of quanity and order, that is to say, when three oranges _(01, 02, 03)_ exist, it is also the case every ordering (01, 03, 02), (02, 01, 03), etc. exists alongside of it. If the latter is the case, we are forced to admit a particular thing is not just one, but a quanta of infinity in the set of all possible orderings at the same. But this is not at all what we mean when we say there are three oranges. We have robbed ourselves of the ability to enumerate.

Did **Descartes** mean _I am_ or _I am this_?

### November 29, 2022

Here is where **Descartes** is wrong: it's impossible to imagine yourself without senses. Every sense brings with it the representative form of space; sight that of perspective; hearing and smell that of proximity; touch that of boundariesl taste that of composition. Each implicitly requires duration for the change to be recognized via is differential in series. In other words, a thing cannot be seen, touched, tasted, smelled or heard without time and the causal continuity therein which ties the form identical throughout succession with the change it is undergoing.

Every sense, in addition, can only represent what is given to it in some way. Whether the world as we know it is a dream or controlled by a malevolent intelligence, the objects which we perceive must ultimately conforms to the laws of causality. Even dreams, where real world logic no longer controls the course of events still holds to this; even the strangest dream requires color, sound or some dimension of representation. And what comes to be through representation is ultimately reducible to some object, whether or not our representation conforms to reality in an adequate way being irrelevant. 

The **Cartesian** demon that pulls the veil over eyes, that presents us with fictious images as if they were real, must still operate through causality, whether or not those causal laws map to ours. The images we are presented can not arise from Nothing, but must be presented through the senses, which by their nature must perceive objects. If those objects thus represented do not obtain reality in our world in the sense that our representative forms are forever deceived of their true nature, that simply implied the mapping of truth occurs in the demonic reality, where the demon is capable of affecting the object of our reality, for affectation is presumed in any such imagining, that is to say, we are deceived because we are affected, via our sense, by some _thing_. If all of reality is a lie, that still implies it is a thing that deceives, and deception requires that there exist a truth for concealment. Our reality, though deception, must still be a picture drawn of _something_.

---

Here is the author's test for whether a thing is alive: did it cry when it was born? No? Then it's not alive.

---

I do not expect to be understood, for that is what it means to be human. I do not expect anyone to read these words. They will nto lead to any sort of enlightenment or understanding, for those things are ultimately what we all seek, they are beyond the province of our Being. That life is futile, I think, we all secretly know. That all proofs of higher meaning are not worth the paper on which they are written. We are incapable, by our very nature, of understanding our natures, being participants in that nature.

All the glorious insights of philosophy are undone by time. We wander through life like half-mad beggers, clawing at whatever passerby looks kind enough to spare a few dollars. Into the towering skyscrapers, where the omniscent live, we will never climb, condemned to die starving in a dumpster.

Death removes all possibility of absolute certainty.

To see this, we need only note that not only is it the case that it cannot be known whether after Death there is a heaven and hell, or a process of reincarnation, or an awareness without experience, or a perpetual waking into another reality, these events cannot even be assigned probabilities in any sense of the term. What would a probability outside the domain of immediate experience mean? WIth respect to what would a proposition about what happens outside of experience be uncertain?

Uncertainty is a state of incompleteness, where knowledge cannot be attained because it is separated from Being by a layer of possibility. We do now know if the world outside of ourselves exists as it appears to us, for it is always a possibility that we are a brain in a vat, subject to the mind probes of the **Cartesian** demon.

A possibiilty is a type of a quantity that transmits uncertainty to reality through Being possible. In this sense, possibility and probability are synonyms. Just as all probabilities must sum to one, all possibilities must converge towards Being, but just as the distribution of an event's probability cannot be known without previous measurement so that before an event's first occurance our prior assumption about its nature can only be a completely random guess and our knowledge can only extend towards its true shape asymptotically, never actually transcending uncertainty, we must also acknowledge that, whatever Being is, it is only what it is insofar that it is possible it might not be what it is, i.e. you might be reading these words in a dream.

What happens outside of our Being is not possible, because to be possible means, first and foremost, a potential, at a certain time and place, to come to be.

What then does the proposition _it is possible there is an afterlife_ mean? How does something come to be outside of time and space? How does something come to be without being the consequence of something? One might as well say _it is possible that possibility is impossible_. 

Then, there are two types of uncertainty: An _ontological_ uncertainty, which admits of quantization as a measure of possibility, for it is an uncertainty about Being, and a _metaphysical_ uncertainty, which admits of no quantiziation because its actualities never obtain in Being, even through appearances, for it is an uncertainty about appearance and existence itsefl. 

_Ontological_ uncertainty is the primary mode of our Being, its foundation. Because we are uncertain of everything, Being becomes a series of possible events.

_Metaphysical_ uncertainty is absolute. It cannot be overcome by quantifying its possibilities and placing your faith in the most likely outcome, for there are no metrics by which to say which outcome possibly occured.

### December 3rd, 2022

IT should come as no surprise, given the importance and precedence of Being, that it is in the origins of humanity's culture and religion that we likewise find the beginning of the historical account of BEing. The Bibel, while its historical accuracy may be up for question, nonetheless servers as a time capsule for our understanding of Being, circa four thousand years ago. In its very first passages GOd reveals to Moses his true nature _I am what am_. 

God's reply to Moses has been translated to English in numerous ways: _I am what am_, _I am that am_, _I am that always is_. This is what is meant by the name Judaism gave to God, *Yahweh*, if the interpretation of its Hebrew is understood through the tetragrammaton. Derived from the root word _hayah_, the Hebrew word for _to be_, *Yahweh* means literally what is, what comes to be, what will be, what exists.

Our earliest accounts of God are draped in the semantics of Being. Our first inclination to the divine, insofar as it has come down to us, was an expression of what is meant by Being, in particular the Being of the divine, and the Being of the divine is identified exactly as the type of Being contained in the proposition _I am_.

God is what I am, the Bible tells us. Interpretted in the literal sense, this account of the divine identifies our type of Being, the Being that is contained in the I's _am_, as a separate sort of Being from that of other Beings, and this separation is exactly equivalent to divinity. 

It is then with great care we should set to analyzing what type of Being it is that we have, for our earliest accounts of it equate it to the divine.

---

What significance does the linguistic invention of Being (or should we say the formal representation of Being?) bring with it in the history of language and humanity? One need only consider what sorts of language are possible without it and what sorts of systems of thought they set up in their wake.

---

Being allows the assignment of attributes to things and the relation of things between one another to become manifest. With the invention of Being, we have, in language, a way of understanding what and where and when we find ourselves.

How would one talk about abstractions liek color and sound without the notion of Being? There is no commonality of things, no way of abstracting their salient essence into a group, without the notion of _is_ providing its basis. 

These things _are_ orbits, those things _are_ planets. What is in common between these Beings, if not the mode of their presentation as an operation of abstraction? Being is what individualizes sets of thigns that are encountered in the world.

---

The modern world has, by virtue of its historicality, filled in the meaning of most words we know, so that when we come to be, we are not inventing language, but discovering its pre-existing meaning. We learn the words of the Other as if they were objects unto themselves. This process hides the origin of language.

Language begins in Being. It is a way of describing the nature of things. The world can be known through information because there is a correspondence of forms between the parts of a language and the their complex and the world at large. The progression of causality is captured in the symbolic form of _modus ponens_, i.e. `(A & A -> B) -> B`.  The way we are in the world, that is the range of language.

---

It must have been surprising to the first Being who recognized in lagnuage the image of the world, for that is truly when sentience began. Akin to a photograph or painting, a sentence is a reflection of Being; even when a painting depicts a fiction, it still does so by the dimensions of necessity, through color and perspective, through representation; the same can be said of a sentence, for when we sketch the image of a paritcular in the proposition _the pencil is over there_, we have, with words, captured the type of relation a pencil has with respect to us. We have "photographed" Being, reduced its momentary effervescence to a repeatable, encounterable form.

This is how we must understand the passage from Genesis, _God made man in his image_. God is, in the old Testament, defined as all that becomes, as the essential and primary Being; furthermore, that Being is the type of Being implied by the conjugation of _is_ into _am_, the Being of the first person singular. This word, a literal image in our language of our Being, is the form umbued to us by our creator, or so the Bible says.

---

The Bible should probably be understood as humanity's first recorded attempt at ontology, our initial step towards understanding Being.

---

That _is_ exists in all its forms (_is_, _was_, _been_, _being_, _has been_, etc) speaks to the diversity of ways of Being. That we take for granted these ways of Being were always obvious must be concered, for language can and have existed without the multiplicity of forms of Being unique to English. In what ways our experience changes when we lack the concepts to elaborate it is a difficult question to answer.

---

Animals can abstract, as was shown by **Pavlov**'s famous experiments. Dogs possess the ability to identify an event with its representative form, if it is trained to expect that event in the presence of its symbolization. Whether or not the notions of existence and BEing occur within the dog is another question, but the raw material for their emergence is atleast present in canines.

Is it enough that we have this brief moment where we are capable of creating and sharing, of love and tenderness, even though it is fated to mean nothing forever after? That all we sow we shall never know, that we plant trees for generations that will never know our names, this is all that can be granted as the best possible outcome. We do not give voice to the silent thought that outlines the worst possible outcome, lest it in fact be the case, that once we die, it will be as if nothing ever was and all our acts, intentions and feelings will retroactively come undone, never to have been because Nothing was all that ever existed in the first place.

Is it cause for despair that we will never understand what we are, no matter how hard we try? THat we must admit there is no answer to any of life's fundamental questions is itself without question. You cannot answer the question, _what am I?_, in any satisfactory sense. The author invites the reader to try; he will gladly read the five hundred page dissertation that results, even though he already knows its conclusion: certainty does not extend into the realm of Death.

Aha, the rationalist exclaims. Certainty is not a prerequisite of knowledge, they reply. For the knowledge of _if A, then B_ contains in it a quanta of knowledge, namely the implcation that exists between A and B, but it makes no claim on the existence of either A or B, onlying saying what is the case if they are given. THus it can be said here we have knowledge that does not rely on the appearance of A or B. One need not be certain of A to conclude _if A then B_.

This is not what is meant by the proposition _certainty does not extend into Death_.

---

If logic can be said to be complete, it must ultimately be applied to untangling the problem of what we are, or else it cannot claim to have a complete basis for the becoming of Being in its totality and must forever remain incomplete. But logic cannot, in a fundamental way, handle the mechanics of our Being, what it means to say _I am_. To do so would require a basis of experience outside of experience by which experience can become a thing, but experience _is_ the basis by which things enter into Being, ours included. How does one say _I am_ without interpretting it as the experiential _I_?

Let us suppose the contrary, for example, that our Being is just the aggregation of particle physics. Knowledge of this does not in anyway undo the immediacy of experience. There is no equation that will, once understood, dissolve our Being into its constituent logic. We will not one day become inert symbols on the page (unless we mean after our Death, when all we were will be words in history books...) for we cannot be anything but what we are and the question of what we are cannot be answered with certainty.

If it were the case that our Being was, in its primary essence, contained in the laws of physics and mathematics, there will come a day when a(n) (un)lucky physicist is solving his equations and recognizes in their computation himself and not merely his image, but himself as emobided in the equation; for that is the conclusion of rationalism, that we must be redicble to priors, and those priors must ultimately be reducible to forms of time and space. If taht is so, then we are in the representations that represent us already already, for our Being cannot be anything but what it is and so if it is mathematical, then what we are is already mathematical, and upon our discovery of its foundation we will have found outside ourselves a quanta of experience, experience outside of experience. The end result of rationalism is to find yourself in two distinct places at the same time, which any rationalist would admit is absurdity.

### December 9th, 2022

ALl things are only things insofar as they are representations. Representations are representations insofar that simultaneous impressions are coordinated and apprehended across our senses.

Suppose this were not the case.

Is it possible to imagine a consciousness existing in a way where streams of sense data did not correspond to one another? To make it purely hypothetical, is it possible to wire up a "brain in a vat" so that it receives sight data from one source, touch data from an entirely different source, taste from yet another, etc? In other words, in a science-fiction update to **Plato**'s cave, what would the consciousness thus described conceive if all it saw was television static and heard only white noise, while random sensations impinged upon its nervous system? WOuld it be capable of representing anything at all to itself? WOudl it have thoughts? How would they be represented internally? WOudl it understand that it has a body? If so, to which sense would it ultimately ascribe concrete reality?

In order to understand the true nature of BEing, this is an experiment we would have to conduct. WIthout isolating the variables properly, there is no way to tell consequence from correlation. Yet there isn't one conscious Being who wouldn't hesitate at such an experiment, for it would entail creating a conscious Being for the express purpose of killing it. Because we know, innately, no consciousness woudl be possible in such a scenario; the BEing that come out the other end would hardly have claim to its Being. Why do we think this?

Of course we know abotu feral children who lose the ability to speak once past a certain age, but there is somethign more fundamental, something not dependent on the human part of our Being. THe world before us only exists insofar that it has a cause, a prior state from which its current state is a direct consequence. If we deprive a BEing of the material of causality, i.e. an external world triangulated through the corresponding sense data, then we have deprivedc it of the possibility of understanding and intellect, of Being an _I_.

If we woke up tomorrow and found what we saw no longer corresponded to what we felt, or that what we heard had no relation to either, then the conditions for our psychological unity would breakdown immediately. THere is nothing, no ground, by which to say what you experience now is continuous with what you just experienced; indeedc, there is no reason to suppose sapce or time exist in such a psychology. How long our concept of self maintains in such a state is an open question, although certain conclusions can be inferred from schizophreniocs. In particular, the catatonic variety appear to enter in a vegative state when the cacophony of sense data ceases to make sense.

To what extent can our sense impressions be false? DOesn't the notion of false presuppose that the falsity of one sense can be ascertained through the coordiantion of the other senses? What we see may be a hologram or illusion, but through touche we determine our sight is incorrect, or incomplete to be more precise; indeed, the intellectual insight that one of our senses doesn't correspond to the external world as represented by the other senses leads to an inquiry as to why that is so, i.e the reason for the deception is sought within causality, what perceptible thing is the cause of our false sensation, and that perceptible thing onyl exists insofar that it is represented in our other "validating" senses.

If we suppose that all of our sense data is false, in true **Cartesian** fashion, what exactly have we supposed? It is not that the external world does not exist, but rather it does not exist in a causal fashion, that things cannot be ordered through cause and effect.

The assumption of the validity of sense data is equivalent to the representative form of causlaity, that things are affected by other things, that all things can be described as the result of an underlying cause, that any single thing to which we devote our attention has a ground against which it is drawn, the world itself.

### December 11th, 2022

**Schopenhauer**'s first contribution was the division of understanding and knowledge. Understanding is an act of perception whereas knowledge is an act of the intellect. The difference is that of sensation versus representation.

He showed this through an analysis of sight, i.e. the knowledge of distance and depth, does not arise vai its raw sensuous impression, for the very reason that light rays refracted through the pupil invert the image; Were our perception based in sensation, we should perceive things upside down, for that is how the world is physically presented to us. That our perception is not inverted speaks to how our representation of the world arises through the intellect. 

Things are objectified into representations through the operation of the intellect.

### December 14th, 2022

We have seen the existence of numberability implies the existence of non-Being through the phenomenon of ordering.

What, then, is meant by the BEing of Number? That numbers are is obvious in the declarations _this is one_, _this is two_, etc. And yet it is obvious that a certain class of numbers are not, that is, ordinal numbers. They are only represented in BEing in a degenerate way, with the expression of limits, in the suppositions that are made about processes that extend into infinity. WHen we write _aleph null_, we are expressing the idea of a coincidence of Being that cannot be, that is, all possible orderings of all possible things; this ordering is not spatial or temporal, i.e. it is not perceptible, it is an ordering that exists in Nothign, except perhaps thought.

It cannot come to be that we see a Being that has a phenomenal representation that in any way maps to the signification implied by _aleph null_; the process of ordering must occur within Being through the temporal dimension, which necessarily occurs in a numerable sequence, i.e. this precedes that, that precedes another, ad infinitum, each moment emanating from the next through a serial ordering of causality; Being in virtue of time impose an order on the possibility of things, this order being its `factic` trajectory; to find a Being that contains more things than the order imbued by time must necessarily exist, if at all, outside of Being. We therefore only encounter it through symbols, through objects which stand for something else.

**Cantor**'s great contribution to mathematics was shwoing the necessity of existence of non-Being. It is from this we are now able to retrospectively look and judge the true place of mathematics in history.

**Badiou** argued mathematics is ontology. But this is wrong, for mathematics contains theorems not only about what _is_ the case, but what is _not_ the case. There is no contingency in mathematics for its concepts to apply to Being; Mathematics is concerned with the conditions of existence, given an interpretation of Being. The mutual exclusion of Euclidean, hyperbolic and elliptic geometrics that result from the different permutations of the parallel postule show mathematics must necssarily take the form of the necessity of possibility, _not_ the necessity of Being. 

For this reason, proper and rigorous mathematics is metaphysics. Ontology is only mathematical insofar that it is a supposition of priors, an instatntion of metaphysical principles; ontology is the inquiry into the peculiar charateristics of Being; metaphysics is inquiry into what might have been otherwise.

The essential question of ontology is whether it is possible to go from the particularity of Being to general principles of Being. The essential question of metaphysics is how generality conditions particular instances of Being. 

### December 15th, 2022

It is Death we see in the fact that philosophy must always remain incomplete. If Being were absolutely infinite, there would exist the possibility of mapping up through the infinities of all possibilities to the task of completion. But it is a fact of all philosophies, in the proper sense of the term, that they are necessarily incomplete. It is therefore the case things are finite. If things are finite, they must end. What is it we find at the end? Death.

### December 17th, 2022

In the foundation of mathematics, this notion of Being, that of predicate logic, this is such and such, is abstracted into pure form.

The notion of Being is captured in mathematics through the idea of sets. In an informal way, an element object is said to belong to a set if it can be predicated by a property defining that set. _4 belongs to the set of even numbers_, therefore we say _4 **is** even_. It is through an object's membership in a set, an abstraction, that its Being is ascribed.

WHat are the conditions for an object to _belong_ to a set? What does this notion of _belong_ mean? 

**Russell**'s paradox. Axiom of abstraction versus the axiom of separation.

### December 19th, 2022

And now we turn to the task of destroying all that we have built. Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say, we now turn to fact what we have built in order to watch it crumble into its foundations.

This is what Death demands. And so we are compelled to obey. As if we had a choice otherwise.

### December 20th, 2022

My form of philosophy consists in consuming everything that has ever been written on a subject, digesting it and then excreting it. At that point, the excretion is sculpted; all things that are unprocessed, the nuts and corn niblets of other's thoughts and arguments, regurgitated without nutritive value, are pruned and widdled down until all that remains is me. 

My thoughts are polished shit.

### December 21st, 2022

The answer to what we are has, in the estimation of the author, had three traditional answers, each seemingly corresponding to the level of a civilization's scientific ability.

1. We are nature.
2. We are divine.
3. We are nothing.

To what extent do these answers contain the corrollaries:

4. We are awareness.
5. We are knowledge.
6. We are uncertainty.

---

Every philosophy who has ever pronounced an apriori principle should be hunted for sport, and if they survive and still hold to their previous delcaration, then at least we will know they believe what they are saying. 

Philosophers and existentialists tend to dismiss the anthropological dimension of history as happenstance, as facticity that is inessential in the formation of insight into the question of what we are. 

The great success and failure of **Marxism** is his development and interpretation of an ontological system that describes the trajectory of history. **Marx**, however, aggregated over the incorrect quantity of labor. Labor is not a constant concept throughout history. Its meaning is a function of the semantical concepts available in a given language. What labor is depends on that by which it can be known.

There is only one constant throughout human history and that is Death. SInce it is never known intuitively, it has remained outside of the meanings capable of formulation in any language. We may interject at any point in history and find a cognate for Death. Indeed, it is one of the only thigns we can actually infer about ancient humans, that they died. Anything else is speculation.

---

To what extent are _is_ and _am_ derivatives of a common actuality?

Is the common derivation of _is_ and _am_ from Being an artifact of language, a mere semantical construct, or is this commonality representative of an actual ontological union?

THat is to say, do the constructs of our language have meaning outside of language?

What is the limit of language? **Wittgenstein** tells us not to be misled by the colloquial form of language, taht of written symbols and spoken speech, into supposing language is confined to script or speech. Language is the art of transmitting meaning through symbols, it is the juxtaposition of forms into coherent thoughts, the structuring of a situation through representation. If, as **Schopenhauer** suggets, nothing comes to Being except as representation (**Badiou** removes the _re-_ prefix here and calls Being the "presentation of presentation"), and if language is merely representation, then by the transitive property, everything is language. Everythin can be interpretted as a symbol in a proposition.

If this is the case, then inquiring into the implicit structure of language, that is to say, seeking the answer to the question of wheter all language is derived from a universal, existential grammar, is equivalent to the pursuit of ontology, of the philosophical question that extends back to Plato and beyond; whether or not there is a basis to understand what is through what we are.

Then, it is with great interest we should seek the utmost clarity in what "rules" govern the consistent, comprehensible constructions of language.

### December 28th, 2022

There is in philosophy a constant feeling of confusion. YOu read **Heidegger** like a drunk attempting to do a crossword and when you find a word that fits the squares, you get a rush of insight, a ha!, this is what he meant, and then see the rest of the squares still mostly blank and you being to wonder if you're smart enough to understand. If you possess the ability to see what these people saw. If there are enough hours in your life to even being to comprehend the simplest of their thoughts.

And in the darkest, most disconnected moments, you wonder if even they knew what they were talking about, if it's all just what it appears to be: nonsense.

Read **Tarski** or **Russell** or **Whitehead**. Not the popular books aimed at the laymen, but this opuses, their great works of intellectual accomplishment. You are like an ant trying to do algebra in comparison to them. You will never possess their insight.

You will die before you do anything near as great at them.

**Badiou**, I think, understands that philosophy is child's play for real mathematicians, that mathematics has exceeded philosophy and will never be overtaken again.

The complexity of the world is hidden by impenetrable equations and theorems that don't make sense.

## December 30th, 2022

Does Being exist as as symbol in propositional calculus. The Being of _beon_, _ουσία_, and the like. 

Logic does not exist with contradictions. Contradictions allow anything to be said with a lgnuage and once that occurs, falsehood infects the whole system. Everything becomes suspect and nothing can be proven.

Undecidability is the inability to arrive at a starting point of a proposition.

_This statement is false_.

Each iteration of judgement flips the truth value. If it's false, then it's true. If it's true, then it's false. So on, ad infinitum. Undecidability is the perpetual flipping of this script.

---

A contradiction is: _A is not A_, _A and not A_, etc. A contradiction is something without the possibility of being true.

--- 

Undeciability is a process that unfolds in time. Contradiction is encapsulated by its form.

What, then, is a paradox?

Claim: an undeciable contradiction.

(Does that even make sense?)

What is it in Being ourselves that prevents us from Being other people? Why does our Being require perspective and individuality?

---

Do mathematical theorems have truth outside of ourselves? TO what extent is existence mathematical in the absence of a Being that is mathematical?

Does our description of the appearance of reality ever penetrate to reality itself? WHat is reality outside of our description of it?

We are tempted to say here: reality and its description have a mapping, that the latter represents the former.

But the error of this is seen those intensely personal occurances which have no analogue in description. How does one describe anything subjective without resource to lyricism?

Being inherently has an order, a process that separates each event from the previous through succession. Causality is manifest in time and space; things are a certain way, meaning the sequence of things that led to the current state of the world was just so and not some other way. Causality imposes a particular order on events, excluding the possibility of other orderings. It is a fact of symbolic logic that order relations must be anti-reflexive.

A reflexive relation is one that is the same forwards as backwards, i.e. _x = y_ is equivalent to _y = x_.

An anti-reflexive relation can be seen in the relation of _less than_, i.e. _x < y_ is not equivalent to _y < x_. This asymmetry in the relation is what gives rises to its orderingb. BEcasue the relation cannot be reflected, the field of its values necessarily has an order, that is to say, each integer increases in magnitude, i.e. it is greater than its precedessor. 

The ordering of time and space must necessarily make us ask, what is it about the _am_ that is anti-reflexive? Where is the asymmetry in our BEing to be found? Why are things always one way and not some other way? Why are things perceived in a linear fashion, that is to say, as a succession of form though time? WHat primitve rupture in reflection causes time to move forward, making thigns have an order?

Or would it be more correct to say: the _am_ is the asymmetric _is_. In terms of ontological relations, existential Being is the equivalency relation. Subjective Being is the ordering relation.

---

_I am this_.

_This is I_.

When reflected, the _am_ becomes an _is_. Is this purely linguistic? Or is this the aforementioned rupture in the relation of Being? The _am_ is one-directional. It latches to its subject's stream of consciousness and severs it from reflexivity. The _am_ reduces to _is_ when the subject is object. 

---

The _is_ does not have this property.

_This is a person_.

_A person is this_.

_Is_, in other words, is reflexive. There is no ordering in the existential relation of Being. It is, as mentioned, an equivalency relation.

--- 

The question, as always, is: is subjective Being the same as objective Being? And if it is, why does our linguistic representation of it bare the features of severance and orderingb? Why does langauge allow the relation of _am_ to operate in a non-reflexive way? Isn't this a necessity of language, the asymmetry of _am_, if language is represent Being?

**Heidegger**'s claim: Time _is_ the asymmetry in Being.
