The investigation of the appearance of Death reveals plainly the nature of Life. WHen we witness Death, we see that Life is process and Death is what happens when that ends.

If we pass through the gates of solipsism and finally admit there must be existence outside of ourselves, we might therefore conclude we atleast have attained an uncertain confidence in the validity of our Being.

As proper scientists, we resolves to that aforementioned ballast of cotnradiction. It is an oft misunderstood tenet of statistical reasoning that a hypothesis can be proved true; instead, a hypothesis can only be assumed in order to be shown false. And in this dialectic we will inevitably slip back into the inescapable gravity of Death.

For the nature of science is to hold up a hypothesis and the form of its consequences to the existent and thus determine whether the given data disproves the assumptions by aligning their representative forms to one another and checking for error.

The relations of Being to Deathexpressed in neologistic prepositions:

- Being-not-before
- Being-always-near
- Being-never-here
- Being-always-before-Death
- Being-always-with-Death
- Being-not-in-death

If we now toy with the likely hypothesis that Death is a form of ontological negation, we see only in one of the proposed relations any hint of negation. Upon reflection, the negation in the other forms is hiding.

Death as hiding, or that which is hidden.

**Pessimist**: would could possibly happen?

**Optimist**: the best of all possible worlds.

**Pessimist**: and then what?

We now turn to oen of the most important sections in establishing the validity of the proposed postulates of Death, the Death of the Other.

We start with a question: how do we know we die?

To make the intent of the question more plain, let us recast it: WOuld a human raised in isolation, unexposed to the DEath of the Other, comprehend its own mortality?

The reason Death is oft overlooked as an ontological constatnt is that it is not apparent in the consciousness of Being until the organism has matured to a certain stage. We admit to the difficulty of untangling this problem from its uniquely human characteristics. It is hard to qualify Death as the essential feature of Being because as humans we do not understand it ourselves until a certain age and a certain complexity of thought is reached.

If we supposed Death is essential to Being, we might be lead to the conclusion an infant does not become a Being until they are cognizant of their demises. We point out, by way of aside, that it is curious how our earliest memories only seem to pop up once we reach a threshold determined, in some respect, by the level of our cognitive development. At what point in the emergence of thought, do we become Beings? Isn't the the question really: At what point in Being, do we become Beings that think? How did we start down this path in the first place?

In looking to the animal kingdom, we might be tempted to introduce the jargon of _grades of awareness_. That Beings possess different _levels_ of awarness, and we might posit the ultiamte form of awareness as that awareness which consists of knowedge lof Death. In this way, we might theorize the biological world casts Being into stratas, but this course reeks of absurdity. How can Being be stratified when I only experience things as they are? I do not _shift_ between different ways of Being. I always _am_, despite the manifold changes that operate on me. Are we to suppose the way a dog _is_ is different, that its Being changes as its world changes?

If the author is granted one contribution to the annals of philosophy, let it be the proof of the futility of any future philosophies.

The totality of forms we use to represent the world contains within it a reference to itself.

As if, existence were indicating: you are form to be found in form.

Death is what individualizes. If there were no Death, then Being would be eternal. There would be no reason to divide it into _this_ Being and _that_ Being.

Consciousness is neither identical to awareness or knowledge.

Consciousness _is not_ the intersection; consciousness is _in_ the intersection.

Philosophy says what is unsaid.

Of course, the un-philosopher says, all I can know is appearance. Why are you saying this? How else could it be otherwise?

To which the philosophy produces four hundred pages to show what is already apparent, but is unsaid, while the un-philosopher retires to enjoy his or her life.

The philosophy, like an ant on a sinking ship, has no notion that his world crumbles around him, no matter how frantically he tries to keep it all together.

Committing their original sin, philosophers suppose what can be said is all there is to say on the matter. Where philosophy fails is in trying to grapple with those unsaid things that are also unsayable.

Being is a relation. This relation implicitly contains the world and the entity that relates to the world. It is the way in which an existent entity is in the world. Being is with respect to the forms it apprehends, an apprehension of forms that necessarily contains within it the form that is apprehending.

Our Being, and the Being of all other entities, is recursive in this sense. It contains a reference to itself. We are insofar that we can be in relation to ourselves.

**Heidegger** conceptualized this type of Being as `Dasein`, in order to distinguish it from the types of Being possessed by things like plants, rocks, number or concepts. Our Being is such that it is concerned with its Being.

**Heidegger** acknowledges the split between ontology and metaphysics, but nevertheless here implicitly references a metaphysical theorem in the construction of his ontology, namely that the Being of some entites, such as rocks and asteroids, are not concered with Being. Indeed, it seems a likely hypothesis on which to build an ontology: that our Being is distinct from other BEings of a certain species or genre. It is apparent in the world that we, as humans, have unique properties that distinguish us from, say, a park bench. Appearances, however, are no foundation for an ontology. SO that is all it can remain: a hypothesis, a proposition whose truth is to be ascertained empirically, a posteriori. It is, on the contrary, a prior assumption we bring to our ontologies, over and above the ontic priors we implicitly bring with us int our apprehensions, the very priors of which we are trying to discern. IF we build a top a mixture of priors and posteriors, how are to separate the consequences of our assumptions, the consequences of our priors and the variations with respect to one another? If the ontological pursuity is understood as the removal of factical posteriors masquerading as priors from an understanding of our Being, then we must not allow ourselves to be fooled into thinking there is a basis for the differentation of Being into partitions. **Heidegger** means as much when he talks about the _unity_ of Being.

Death is a proposition about form: that it will cease to be.
