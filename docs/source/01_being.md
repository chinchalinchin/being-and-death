## The Question

**Albert Camus** once stated there is but one philosophical question and that is suicide[^Camus#1]. In this, **Camus** skipped over much to arrive at his starting point. However, to his credit, he only meant it in the rhetorical sense, as way to examine the absurdity of living in a universe where you are fated from the very start to die at the end. Nevertheless, there is a definite proximity to primordial truth in his formulation of the so-called "_philosophical question_". 

This is what **Camus** got wrong: There is no choice to be made in the face of Death. _All_ life is suicide, in a sense; it is merely the method of dying we are allowed to pick, and only then up to a point, as the survivors of self-inflicted gunshot wounds will attest. When one chooses to die, all that is accomplished is akin to skipping ahead to the end of a book. Everyone implicitly knows time is a poison that slowly kills, for it is taught to us from the very second of birth; a new-born infant left to its devices would surely die and if its cries can be understood at all it is only as a gasping for life, a choking on Being, a dim awareness that it is a thing and it is in mortal danger; Death is not conceptualized intellectually in this moment, but is apprehended in the nearest glance we ever get at its true form, that of unbridled fear and uncontrollable passion, a void where no reason can prevail; only through the intervention of an Other thing, a Being outside ourselves, is the infant we were allowed to live; from this we learn, or are atleast given the raw material for the conception of, causality, that our Being as a thing is affected by the Being of Other things, and, this being the point, that this affectation arises as an alteration of the infant's trajectory towards Death: a thing which is Other to ourselves prevents us from dying in our very first moment as a separate entity. If, in what follows, we come to see the Other as life, then it is only insofar that our Deaths are held at bay with their cooperation. Life, in this formulation, is not a positive phenomenon, but a denial of a total Nothingness. I am because I am not dead, and I do not die, at least for the time being, because the Other is and will not let me.

Only in the sequel, once Death is no longer immediate, do we come to understand the nature of time, in the way leaves wilt on dead tree limbs, in the way organic material rots, in the way delicate things are liable to break. A Being cannot _be_ without the phantom of Death shadowing its every step, making its presence known obliquely. All of these things we must realize before we consider the philosophical problem of terminating our own lives. Only in the subsequent development of self, once reflective consciousness enters into the equation, and we realize we are of a genre with all those things that pass away from Being in an abstract sense, do we ask whether or not a life always imperilled is worth living.

The thesis of the present work can be summed up succinctly in the opening paragraphs, so that no one need read any further and may at once put these words to rest so as to never think on them again: Death is the bedrock at the bottom of Being; it precedes us in every way, before knowledge and language, before awareness of time and space, before the birth of our historical self. In order to be we must possess the ability to die, first and foremost. As such, we are condemned to die simply by Being. Whether we die in ignorance or with full awareness of our mortality matters not to Death, because Death is not something that _cares_. From this and because of this, all things proceed. 

Despite being the foundation of almost every human pathology, Death as a field of inquiry has received comparatively little analysis over the course of history, except in the medical sciences where it is treated clinically, to be catalogued and diagnosed along with all the other maladies and diseases and thus placed into a knowable relation with the rest of Being, or in the spiritual studies, where it is mythologized and understood only through metaphor, never as an experience that happens _to_ us.

There is a reason for this: Death as a subject is repellant to individual understanding. Its very definition presupposes the limit of the knower; That is to say, Death is inherently unknowable. Death can only be understood through the mechanisms of analogy and metaphor, via the circuituous and torturous route of empty symbolism, for when we turn our attention directly to the object of Death it reveals itself as something which is not to be found in our Being. 

We can be aware that we will eventually die, we can perceive Others passing from this world, we can even in unique circumstances perceive the manner of our own Death, but none of this gets us any closer to the experience of Death, none of this allows us to see what it is like to die. Our experience and awareness of experience will never be extended into Death itself. We never see Death for what it is, because it is Nothing, the absence of our Being. Death is the point where experience and awareness stops.

In this way, we mean Death exists beyond the limit of understanding, in a way that destroys that which it transcends. For our Being in the world is inextricably tied to knowledge and an understanding of the world so much so we may be tempted to posit Death as that which removes this possibility from our Being, and thus annihiliates our Being. In this way, as a result of the unknowability of Death, the ontological necessity between our Being and knowledge emerges, for if our Being and Death are inverses and if Death is by definition unknowable, then it must follow that our Being is that which is knowable. The provisional aim of this work is to show this unknowability metaphysically precedes and constrains Being, and that furthermore this constraint imposes upon Being an ontological character. Death, in the unknowability of its Nothingness, illuminates Being. 

Death then, while unapproachable, becomes a way to understand our own Being, for it shows us the domain of the problem, the problem being what it means _to be_ in a world that must by necessity contain our Death. Death is `a priori` to Being, baked into all ontologies, even if their formulations hitherto do not explicitly acknowledge it as such. _To be_ inherently contains the possibility of _not Being_ as a necessary and sufficient condition for coming to be. Because things end in our perception, in time and space, they are differentiated; if all things were never ending, all objects would be continuous with one another, instead of distinct and separate; things are only distinct insofar that they are _not_ identical, so that to be distinct, it must be possible a thing is not something else; so if we then ask, _what is it that our Being is not?_ There is only one answer. The `invariance` of Death is a fundamental constant of nature and thus provides a universal metric by which to unpack existence into representative form. 

It will be argued by philosophers that the author has adopted a humanist perspective and has not sufficiently divested himself of the pecularities of _human_ Being. Death, they will argue, is not an ontological prior, but posterior to the notion of Being, for it is dependent on the numerous attributes of a particular _Being_; chemistry and biology could be otherwise, they will argue, so that life need not by necessity imply Death; the laws of energy, whereby all things eventually dissipate into heat, they will argue, need not be the case; the motivating factor in every human endeavor, they will argue, can be abstracted away from experience, so as to be analyzed in "scientific" isolation. 

This argument will be addressed in great detail throughout the course of this work, but as an immediate reply to those who hold fast the proposition, _it is possible to imagine Being without Death_, the question must be posed: _and what would that look like?_ 

To ask questions about a subject that perpetually recedes from all attempts to know it necessarily entails the admission up front that no answers can ever be conceived, much less perceived. The inevitable end result will be to arrive where we started, back in the here and now, having gained Nothing, except perhaps an understanding of what it means to be futile, which will anyway evaporate when we die; If any proposition can lay claim to human nature, this is it. 

It would seem, then, it does not matter which direction we choose to go, since we will always return to our starting point, no better or worse for having made the circuit. For this reason, the author recommends no one should read what follows. Instead, the reader is advised that going outside is by far a better course of action.

With the warnings of futility thus dispensed, we will preface our discourse with a brief tour through the current state of our understanding of what it means _to be_. If Death, as a philosophical concept, can be said to be anything, then it seems likely it must be as a negation of Being, or at the very least a certain _type_ of Being, the type of Being we ourselves have. 

There is in this an almost natural proclivity to view Death as the opposite of life, the terminus of life or boundary of life. In the colloquial sense, there is obviously true enough, but we are here inquiring in the precise of meaning of Death, the place it occupies in the mechanics of Being. Whether or not the subject of Death's negation is life, or a living thing, cannot yet be concluded, for it is not clear at this stage in what ways not Being dead is equivalent to Being alive, for a rock is said to not be dead, yet we do not conclude from that it is alive. Indeed, upon consideration, the exact definition of life is hard to pin down, for "_what is common among the living is life, but life in itself has no properties, attributes or characteristics. Thus, what is held in common among the living is itself nothing in particular_"[^Thacker#1] We therefore take it as a provisional hypothesis that Death is a negation of a _type_ of Being, not necessarily identical with _life_, with the understanding that we have much to show before this statement can be taken as fact and in what way it is to be understood. We have not yet defined what it, the Being to which we refer in the preceding as subject to Death, _is_ exactly, so that its negation likewise lacks clarity. 

Therefore, we first examine our understanding of Being in general to bring the scope of the problem into view. This will necessarily entail a discussion on the history of philosophy, language and logic, all in reference to how these fields have informed our understanding of Being. What is presented in this first book is by no means an exhaustive commentary, nor should it be taken as a coherent, chronological narrative; what follows is only meant to highlight pertinent concepts as they relate to the current analysis.

The maturity of a field of inquirty can be seen in how close to its foundations its crises occur. Mathematics, by far the most mature of the sciences, took more than two thousand years to move past the crises in its theorems, e.g. the determination of areas, the calculation of ratios, the solution of equations, etc., before finally grappling with the crises in its foundations, e.g. notions of primitives, of numbers, of infinity, of completeness and consistency (<sup><sub>and their inherent mutual exclusion</sub></sup>), etc. This direction of progress bears an interesting feature, in that it is the opposite of what we would expect if the intellect were purely rational. In logic you start with assumptions and apply rules of inference until arriving at the complex conclusion; this is the exact opposite of the actual history of mathematics. Humanity first needed to study the application of mathematics, via the straight edge and compass, via computation and ratio, before grappling with the meaning of its precepts, as if the foundation of mathematics was consequent upon its use. While counter-intuitive, further reflection reveals this is as it should be, for to know a thing deeply you must first know it approximately. There are no marriages built in darkness.

In the last four hundred years, a similar reckoning has been underway in philsophy. As a species, for the past two millenia, we have spent considerable time pondering the ephemeral consequences of morals and aesthetics, taking their existence as givens and working out the results of their application. With the formulation of **Cartesian** scepticism, the artifacts of **Aristotelian** philosophy were shattered in order to examine their constituent pieces and then reworked into grander schemes. A clear line of philosophers extending through **Descartes**, **Kant**, **Schopenhauer** and **Heidegger** began to challenge the notions upon which philosophy itself was built, by applying the analytical methods of rationalism to the most immediate of all datum: experience itself. We thus come to a crisis of philosophy in which even the most elementary questions one would think answerable provoke silence: What _are_ we? What _am_ I? What _is_ this? What _is_, in general? 

All of these questions derive from a more fundamental question: What does it mean _to be_?

There is an inherent problem with the application of the scientific method to the problem of Being, which these thinkers (and innumerable others no less worthy of mention) grappled with at great length, in that a investigation into Being will necessarily come to the point in which it must investigate, as a Being, that which is investigating, i.e. itself. Having placed the faculty of judgement that allows us to draw conclusions about the world _in the world_, we lack the outside perspective to judge the validity of such judgement and are left with only the proposition itself as a ballast, that is to say, the truth of our judgements about Being depend on whether those judgements contain within themselves their own truth, since that truth cannot be ascertained by reference to an external Being when the judgement is about the Being which judges.

By objectifying our Being and making it the focus of study, we necessarily lose its personal subjectivity, and render it unapproachable, passing by each other like two ships in the night. When one attempts to study that which studies, one must careful with the avenues of inquiry one selects to make clear and apparent the object of study, which in this case is no object at all, but the subject itself insofar that it is pure subjectivity.

When philosophy attempts to hew to the scientific method and objectifies the subject, it necessarily becomes formalism. For this reason, the project of philosophy in the modern world, instead of elucidating and clarifying the meaning of these terms with respect to the advances of modern science, by attempting to emulate the results of science outside the domain of its problemset, has become to explain away, not only consciousness, but Being itself, by reducing everything to representation and formulae, as if these representations and formulae did not exist as representation and formulae through our Being first and always before their subsequent interpretation as meaningful significations.

If philosophy is to remain in the modern world a field of inquiry independent of science, science being a field concerned with truth (or at the very least the removal of falsity), then philosophers must seek refuge in meaning, for meaning is the last stronghold not yet stormed by science and for good reason; Science, for all its exactness, cannot touch our Being. No description is capable of anything beyond indicating what is the case; _what is the case_, however, is not an indication, but the actual events that make up the world. Every description is a description _of_ the world _in_ the world; the only way a word could have true Being is if it stood for its own letters, instead of meaning something beyond its letters, something that can only be encountered by a Being that deals in meaning. It is the one and only task of philosophy to explain the way in which this transcedence occurs, and what it is that is happening when this happens. 

Philosophy cannot be disavowed of this task even if that happening happens to be Nothing. Indeed, if what we are turns out to be Nothing at all, then there is no more urgent task to consider than that of philosophy. What other tool [ready-to-hand](HEIDEGGER_TODO) would stand chance against Nothing? In the annihiliating nightmare of nihilism, we all necessarily become philosophers. 

## What is Being?

### The Syntactical Structure and Semantical Origin of Being

The project of philosophy is to make clear what we are, to present for the understanding the concepts which underlie our Being, the Being that occurs when some small pocket of the world turns on the rest and declares itself separate by the proclamation, _I am_. Philosophy should, in its rightful endeavor, provide the basis for understanding how this situation, that of the _am_, comes to be separate from the other types of Being, if that indeed is what is occuring. In essence, philosophy, if it is not to go the way of alchemy or phrenology, must answer the question: _what am I_?. Furthermore, it must does so in a way that distinguishes itself from the fields of pure logic, mathematics or physics. Whether or not philsophy is up to the task is the question currently at hand. 

When asking _what am I?_, we necessarily bring with us an expectation the answer will assume the form _I am x_, or some essential variatian thereof, so that in order to answer this question we must first understand what type(s) of operands may be substituted for _x_  in the above and remain intelligible. We must also stash in the back of our thoughts the creeping notion that it may be the case there is no expression, within the structured forms of linguistic representation, that is capable of answering this question. We shall grant an answer is possible for the moment in order to see where it might lead, in which case, if there is to be an answer to the question _what am I?_, it must necessarily be of the form _I am x_, for the _what_ in the question seeks a solution of the form _x_, of a _thing_ to be determined. 

The type of proposition represented by _I am x_ is a particular case of a more general symbolic proposition, one that can be uncovered by recognizing _am_ is a derivative of the same root as _is_ (more on this tacit assumption to follow shortly), so that _I am x_, which might be rephrased more verbosely as _that which is me is x_, is really governed, at least in the limit, by the same algebra that governs simpler primitive terms captured symbollically by  _this is x_. We thus must preface our answer to _what am I?_ with an answer to _what is this?_.

Before doing so we clarify a few things.

**Relativizers and the Relative That**

---

The use of _that_ in the preceding _that which is me_ is to be understood as a linguistic [relativizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativizer), and not the indicative _that_ which opposes the _this_. It is the _that_ identified in the construction _this is something that is useful_ as opposed to the _that_ identified in the construction _that is something_. In the latter case, the _that_ is a quantification, a particular case, a _thing_. In the former case, the _that_ is no _thing_, but a way of nesting a relation of Being contained in the secondary predicate, _is useful_, so that its content flows back to the subject whose Being was previously indicated, the _this_ which is _something_. 

The role played by _that_ in a _relativizer_ has the same structure as the _that_ used in that indicative sense, in that it encapsulates its operand into a single unit and binds together its multiplicites so as to ready it for substitution into the conjunctive form. But whereas the indicative _that_ gathers the subject for the operation of the predicate, the relative _that_ reflects back its predicate onto the subject of its attached proposition.

The construction _this is something that is useful_ is logically equivalent to the conjunction of the separate propositions _this is something_ and _something is useful_. There is, however, a subtle difference in meaning. The conjunction of propositions implies its components are atomic, that is to say, both _this is something_ and _something is useful_ are separate propositions that attain a new meaning when conjoined, whereas the relativized statement unit the distinct parts into a continuous whole, so that is properties may not be separated. 

The _relativizer_ and the relative _that_ are useful devices, but whether or not they are necessary grammatical forms is not so apparent. _Here is something that is useful_ may be replaced in almost all cases to the similar form _here is something useful_. Colloquially, the phraseologies are near enough equivalent that they may be treated the same, but the question remains on the philosophical level if the difference is an artifact of linguistic ambiguity and inconsistency or if a _relativizer_ deserves a special place in the grammar of Being. 

The _relativizer_ exists in the oldest languages of which we still have historical documentation. It plays a central role, for instance, in the name early humans gave to God. In the opening books of the Torah, within the text of **Exodus**, God reveals his true name to Moses on Mount Sinai[^Torah#1], 

> And Moses said unto God: 'Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them: The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me: What is His name? what shall I say unto them?'

> And God said unto Moses: 'I AM THAT I AM'; and He said: 'Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel: I AM hath sent me unto you.'

God's reply to Moses, derived from Hebrew,

> אֶהְיֶה (ehyé) אֲשֶׁר (’ăšer) אֶהְיֶה (ehyé)

has been translated numerous ways: _I am that I am_, _I am what I am_, _I am what am_, _I am that am_, _I am who am_. 

The Hebrew word, אֶהְיֶה, is the first person singular of the infinitive הָיָה, pronounced phonetically as "hâyâh", which translates as _to be, become, come to pass, exist, happen, fall out_[^Strong#1]. Modern Hebrew conjugates God's reply in the future tense, i.e. _I will be what I will be_. However Hebrew at the time did not differentiate tenses. There was no difference, atleast grammatically speaking, in Ancient Hebrew between the notions of _will be_, _has been_ and _is now_. 

The term, אֲשֶׁר, is the semantic device known as a _relativizer_ just discussed. Quite literally, the Hebrew Torah states, God is the _am that am_, where _that_ is understood as a nesting operation, where the Being on the right hand side of the _relativizer_ is ascribed to the Being on the left hand side in addition to its own Being.

The name Judaism gave to God, _Yahweh_, understood through the so-called [tetragrammaton](), in one intrepretation could be seen as an attempt by early humans to distinguish what they are from what is, that is to say, as a way to differentiate the _am_ from the _is_. The choice of first person singular, as opposed to the impersonal third person, is telling in this respect, for it is a claim about the Being of God, namely that God is in the same way the subject of _I am_ is. 

Our first inclination to the divine, as it has come down to us, was an expression of what is meant by our Being, identifying it as equivalent to the Being of the divine. _Yahweh_ is to be understood, in this interpretation, as an assertion that _am_ is distinct from _is_, that what we are is more than what is given to us.  

According to our ancestors' account, God is what _I am_. God is the **Cartesian** _sum_. Interpretted in the literal sense, this account of the divine identifies our type of Being, the Being that is contained in (or revealed by) the I's _am_, as a a separate sort of Being from that of other Beings, and this separateness is exactly what gives rises to the classification of the divine.

**Descartes** himself employs the _relativizer_ in his famous _Discourse_ when he attempts to answer the question _what am _I_. As expected, his answer is of the form _I am x_, but with the aid of a _relativizer_, he is able to add a layer of complexity to the answer, essentially hiding details in the indeterminate form of _x_ with the appropriate use of a relative _that_. _I am a thing that has thoughts_, he replies, "_I was a substance the whole essence or nature **of which** is to think_"[^Descartes#1]

For the final confirmation of the validity of the relative _that_ as an ontological relation, we turn to mathematics. In the primitive symbols of set theory, the function of the _relativizer_ can be seen in the `|` that designates the variables over which a proposition is quantified. For example, the `axiom of abstraction` given in the following symbolic proposition,[^Appendix#1]

`#y | [ @x | x ~ y & P(x) ]`

can be translated into English as _there exists a y **such that** for all x **such that** if and only if x belongs to y, then x has the property P_. The obtuse translation is meant to draw the attention to the analogous role of the `|` and the relative _that_. 

It would seem in trying to answer what we are, a single relation of Being is insufficient and _that_ such answers require grammatical tools _that_ allow for Being to flow recursively through a sentence. We thus revise our expectation of the answer to _what am I_ from _ I am x_ to the form _I am x that y_, where _x_ and _y_ are indeterminate variables.

**The Semantics of Being**

---

With the discussion of the _relativizer_ in mind and its unique role played in certain historical answers to the question _what am I_, there is another point to address, one that cannot be skipped over before proceeding. We have, in the previous paragraphs made the assumption the Being of the _am_ is a cousin to the Being of the _is_. We must now turn to an argument raised by **Alfred Tarski**, in which we must consider _"that the semantical concepts have a relative character, that they must always be related to a particular language."_[^Tarski#1] 

It might be the case the conjugation of _to be_ into its derivative forms, _is_ and _am_, is a conceptual union not born out in the facts. When we talk about the Being of _am_ and compare it to the Being of _is_, are we being misled by the language used to express these ideas into supposing a coincidence of meaning where in fact there is none?

This is, in questions involving Being, the central question: whether _what I am_ is of a genre with _what this is_, and moreover whether this mutual origin is linguistic or ontological. If we are to establish any sort of ontological relation between the meaning of these two terms independent of the knowledge granted by language, we must be careful in understanding **Tarski**'s argument. 

In one reading, we might think **Tarski** is saying meaning, i.e. semantical conceptualization, is ephemeral, a property of a system, without use outside of that system. While not entirely inaccurate, the exact meaning is subtler by far, for his argument relies on the notion of _relative_. 

Things are only said to be _relative_ insofar as there is an invariant quantity available to all frames of reference that allows the calculation of by how much the relative quantities in the system have changed. In **Galilean** relativity, the invariant quantity is space and time, so that all motion is relative to immovable space-time; since all frames of reference measure the same lengths and times, motion is able to be viewed relative to either reference without loss of fidelity. In **Einsteinian** relativity, the invariant is the speed of light, so that space and time themselves are relative to this fixed quantity, and frames of reference will adjust their spatial and temporal metrics accordingly to accomodate this constant.

If meaning is determined by the language from which it arose, what is the ultimate invariant quantity to which language itself must conform in order to prescribe a metric for meaning? With careful thought, the answer is obvious. If there is one constant to be found in all the various languages in the world, at any given time in the spoken history of humanity, it is found in the words: _Be, _Ser_, _Sein_, _Shi_, _Desu_, etc. The invariant of language is, of course, Being itself. In the same way the speed of light requires space and time to become the quantities necessary for its correct calculation, Being requires language to become forms which can represent it.

We are thus asking if the conjugation of _am_ deserves recognition as an ontological operation over and above the existential operation of _is_ which structures language, or if it is a redundancy that is already included in _is_ or merely a semantical construct with no meaning outside of language. If the first case obtains, _am_ provides structure distinct from the structure of the _is_, essentially performing the function of dimensionalizing laneguage, and the question _what am I_ has been granted a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for a meaningful answer. If either of thee latter cases obtain, then the answer we seek is clearly some variation of _I am Nothing_.

Insight into this question can be gained by studying the historical origins of Being in our language. Language is an archeological treasure hiding in plain sight, a living autobiography of history. **Ludwig Wittgenstein** likened language to "_an ancienty city: a maze of little streets and squares, of old and new houses, and of houses with additions from various periods; and this surrounded by a multitude of new boroughs with straight regular streets and uniform houses_"[^Wittgenstein#1] In other words, language is not an absolute, but a process, constantly shifting forms and revealing new realms of meaning, but retaining its essential function: that of representation and signification. 

In modern English, _Being_ is the marriage of two concepts that were previously distinct. Its etymology descends from the coupling of the Old English words _beon_ and _wesan_, which can be in turn, if the theorists are to be believed, traced further back to the Proto-Indo-European roots of _bheu_ and _wes_, respectively. For this reason, we conjugate from the infinitive _to be_ _B_-root words _be_, _been_ and _being_ and _W_-root words _was_ and _were_. _Is_, a direct cognate from Old English, is the present tense conjugation of _wesan_, revealing its hereditary from the _es_-stem roots that form the concept of Being in other Proto-Indo-European languages, such as the Spanish _estar_ or TODO. 

It is in the meaning of these words prior to their symbosis we shall find a starting point for understanding the separation of _am_ and _is_. The differences between the semantic function of _beon_ and _wesan_ is slight, but potent.

_Wesan_ is the Being of objects and nouns. It is the _is_ of the _this_ and _that_, the _the_ and the _a_. When affixed to a name, _wesan_ indicates existence, what is actual about its subject. _He is here_, _you will be tired_, _there are three of them_. These are all existential statements of particular cases, facts which can be determined true or false by reference to reality. This type of concrete Being is contained in _wesan_. TODO EXAMPLE TODO
 
To put it succinctly, _wesan_ is the empirical _is_, the _is_ which refers to the external world. _Beon_, however, is the Being of the abstraction and adjectives. _Beon_ indicates an object's [gnomic aspect](TODO:wikilink). In the parlance of logic, a _gnomic_ truth is a universal assertion, a statement of generality that applies to all things of which it speaks. While the Being of modern English does not have a direct _gnomic_ form, a _gnomic_ proposition can be induced by the removal of the particularizing article _the_ in the following: _the birds are fast_. The use of _the_ in this sentence refers to a particular group of birds, whereas the proposition _birds are fast_ does not refer to any definite bird, but references the _gnomic aspect_ of birds, i.e. the abstraction of form common to all avian entities.  It is in this context that _beon_ is conjugated in Old English. TODO EXAMPLE TODO

Mandarin has a similar variation in how it unpacks the relations of Being into representative form. In Mandarin, the verb (literal mandarin) _shi_ can only be affixed to nouns, to signs representing physical objects. (literal mandarin) _Ni shi zhongguo ren_; you are Chinese. However, (literal mandarin) _shi_ cannot be affixed to adjectives, such as beautiful. For that, the extra verb (literal mandarin) _hen_ is required. 

We have here  again in _shi_ and _hen_ the distinction of meaning found in _wesan_ and _beon_, that of actuality versus abstraction. Indeed, this is a common duality to be found in languages across the world. 

When _beon_ and _wesan_ were gradually merged in modern English, two meanings came to inhabit the same word. Still, to this day, it could be argued, these meanings have not yet been fully integrated. There are defects in the merger that can be glimpsed, when words falter slightly in their aspect and _Being_ reveals its separate meanings. The English _Being_ haphazardly applies the ideas of concrete and abstract reality simultaneously, thereby allowing assertions of existence to be mixed with assertions of conceptualization, as seen in the propositions _there is love_, _this is justice_, _we are eternal_. The English _is_ is capable of abstracted existence, existence that is not reducible to objective reality.

**Considerations of Logical Consistency**

---

It in this muddle of semantics that we are seeking to extract an answer to the question _what am I_. It is at this point we must ask what it is we require of an answer so that we might recognize it as such. 


A novice logician might reply _consistency_, by which is meant the idea that language is really an axiomatic system from which propositions are constructed according to syntactical rules, so that we start with primitives notions like _set_, _element_ and _belong_, then we formalize the semantics of these concepts with quantified propositions such as _there exists a set_ and _some things have the property of belonging to that set_, then we proceed to define more complex notions such as equivalence through the formalized semantics these primitive notions afford, used in conjunction with the laws of logic (modus ponens, syllogism, etc.), e.g.. _if belonging to a first set implies belonging to a second set and if belonging to the second set implies belonging to the first set, then both sets are said to the be equivalent_. 

_Consistency_ is the idea that all such statements thus constructued, if proceeding from a correct set of axioms (possibly infinite in number), will always yield a determinate statement. By determinate, it is meant, given the truth of the axioms, the truth of the statement can be judged purely as a function of syntax. Or put another way, all statements in the system can be reduced to statements about the primitive notions that compose the foundation of the system. In mathematics, all theorems ultimately become theorems about sets, elements and the concept of _belonging_, when the appropriate substitutions are made for the [definien]() in the complex definitions that are built up through the application of syntax (a mathematical function f(x), for instance, can be defined as a mapping of sets to one another). All meaning in the system is built up through the meaning given to the primitive notions, i.e. what a _set_ is, what an _element_ is and what it means for an _element_ to _belong_ to a _set_. The semantics of the system are entirely incapable of saying what it is these primitive notions actually are, for all meaning in the language system comes from what it is they mean, i.e. the concept _equivalence_ is reducible to the concept of _belonging_, but the concept of _belonging_ has no further definition; it is what is simply what is meant by the symbol `~` in `#A | @x | x ~ A v A = 0`^[Appendix#1]. In other words, the meaning of the primitive notions must be given in the intuition before the syntactical consequences of their meaning is dispersed through the structure of the system. Once the primitive meanings are given, the content of that meaning must necessarily follow the rules of syntax. 

Moreover, _consistency_ requires that any statements which are thus formed should _not_ be capable of contradicting any other proposition formed by the same rules of syntax. Given a set of axioms, it should not be the case, for example, the propositions _there is an x that is A_ and _there is an x that is not A_ should mutually exclude the other's possibility. 

TODO 

Here is as good as place as any to give pause to understanding the difference between syntax and semantics. Consider the arguments:

_All mammals are warm-blooded, all whales are mammals, therefore all whales are warmblooded_. 

_If the ball is dropped, then it falls is equivalent to the ball is falling or it has not been dropped_                                                  
These lines of reasoning are syntactical, because they are valid if their content is abstracted away from them, as seen in the following,

_All x are y, all z are x, therefore all z are y._
_if x then y is equivalent to x or not y._

Strictly speaking, we should only speak of truth when the operation of assertion is involved, so we do not say these propositions are true, for that is the purview of the terms which have been abstracted away from them, but rather these propositions provide the syntax for their asserted content to become true.

TODO

A question that is not often addressed in the literature is whether or not an inconsistent system can still be meaningful. 

If a system is complete, then it is inconsistent. But does the inverse hold? If we start from an inconsistent language, does that imply the lacunae of possible meaning in that language is complete?

TODO

The question of the _am_ is then intricately related to the question of language, and in what way the meaning of the _am_ carries with it the invarance of the _is_ (semantically speaking); that is, in what way the meaning implied by _am_ in language is necessary for language to be language? 

TODO

Separating out the components of the answer to the question _what is this?_, we have in _this is x_ three terms: _this_, _is_, and _x_. The sentence must find its meaning in the meaning of its components. _This_ and _x_ are perhaps the easiest to understand, for they are _existential_ terms. 

_This_ carries with it a unary operation, in that anything thus denoted _this_ becomes a single unit, regardless of its structure. When we say _this is a calculator_, we have amalgamated not only the abstractions of buttons, internal circuitry and plastic casing into a single gestalt, into a single concept, but moreover, we have synthesized the representative forms of color, solidity, extension, etc, into a common form across our senses. _This_ represents the coincidence of forms into conceptual novelty. 

If _this_ is monadic in its application, then _x_ is variadic. Where as the _this_ collasces the different parts participating in the same underlying form, the _x_ disperses the possibility of forms across an infinite range of things. There are many answers to _what is this?_ and in each case the role by the _x_, regardless of its form, remains the same. 

TODO

When we say _a thing is_ and _a thing is this_, we have in mind two different ideas, due to the divergent of Being in English. There is in these two possible applications of _is_ the notions of existence and abstraction, respectively. 

In the former case, the proposition is a claim of existence in general, regardless of its particulars; the proposition _a thing is_ could be restated in equivalent form as _a thing exists_. To achieve the broadest generality and thus bring the full range of meaning into view, we make the subject of the sentence indefinite and say _something is_. 

Allowing the subject of this simple proposition to take on any value, we have arrived at the most elementary proposition that can be expressed in any philosophical framework. It is self-evident, however distorted our perception of the world may be and however uncertain we are of all that we experience, that we can at the very least say, _something is_. What it is this something is, while possibly beyond our ability to comprehend, cannot be Nothing for the simple fact that it _is_. If the world is nothing but illusion, then it _is_ still illusion. 

The **Cartesian** _sum_ is really a particular form of the essential truth _something is_, where the primary state of Being from which all others proceed is assumed to be that of consciousness. The fallacy in this ontological proof _cogito ergo sum_ is the _cogito_ is not primitive; there are truths that precede it in form, namely, the latin _est_, the something which is.

The existence of _something_, of the general thing, is more certain than the I's _am_, because in order to be an _I_, _I_ must first be separate from _something_, _I_ must be differentiated in type and form from the general thing. Therefore, the _something is_ precedes the _I am_. From the thing's general form, the arbitrariness contained in the _some_, we see the _thing_ which _I am not_ that precedes _me_ need not be a particular thing, it need not have any properties except Being distinct from _me_. For this reason, the thing which is prior to _I_ is not necessarily determined in its form; It is only existence, in indeterminate form, that precedes _my_ Being. 

We do not require in this formulation, at this point, that a _thing_'s appearance correspond to its existence, for whether or not things are as they appear is irrelevant with respect to their differentation from _my_ Being. If what I perceive is not what actually is, then it is only because _something is_ that I cannot perceive. Existence must be presupposed before that of consciousness. 

_I_ can not be mistaken for _this thing_, because what _I am_ is not what _that is_. 

TODO


The proposition _a thing is_ says nothing about the ways in which the thing exists, only that it is so, whereas the proposition _a thing is this_ seems to belong to the former case in that it declares not only is it so, but further, it is so in such-and-such a way, so we are easily led to the conclusion the latter is a more particular case of the former. 

TODO

Before drawing that conclusion, let us examine the negation of each, for the relation of the negated parts makes clearer the relation obtaining between the original parts.

When we say _a thing is not_, we mean that it does not exist. With this claim, a _thing_'s potential to be a _thing_ has been removed, except removed absolutely in the sense that it can never be in the first place. We must be careful in the interpretation of this proposition, for we bump against the process of Being when we vaguely apply the rules of conjugation and propose: _this does not exist yet, but it may come to be_ or _this did exist, but now no longer does_. For we have invited the notion of Being in through the backdoors of _does_ and _did_, when what we wanted was to examine the notion of negated existence in isolation. We therefore clarify that by existence we do not mean with respect to time and space, but absolutely in itself. 

As an example, we could say _God is not_, _unconditional love is not_ or _a color without an electromagnetic frequency is not_. When we say _God is not_, we are careful not to include, even in thought, the addition of _here_, i.e. _God is not here_, for that would undo the whole meaning, implying that God might instead be over _there_. _God is not_ is an absolute denial of existence, a removal of possibility from the world entire. 

The negation of _a thing is this_ does not undo the _thingness_ of the subject, but rather the source of its _thingness_. In the negation of this proposition, the existence of the underlying subject _thing_ is not negated; indeed, it is affirmed as an instance of something but not of _this_. _A thing is not this_ does not mean the thing does not exist, but rather that it exists, but is not given by the thing we mean by _this_; we may therefore say _a thing is that_. It is therefore the case the proposition _a thing is not_ is not contained in the proposition _a thing is not this_, for a thing which is not this is still a thing. 

As an example, we could say _God is not this_ and we do not thereby deny his existence, only his particular form. If God is not this, then he must be _that_. Being is a division of existence into what is _this_ versus what is _that_.

In other words, _a thing is this_ and its negation _a thing is not this_ both assume the existence of the underlying thing. The negation of one does not nullify the existence of its subject, so that whatever is meant by _a thing is_ belongs to both _a thing is this_ and _a thing is not this_. Nowhere to be found in either proposition are the effects of _a thing is not_.

This may be seen in another way. If the relation between Being and existence is one of containment, then it is either the case they are identical, a thing exists without being or a thing can be without existing. The first case, that of identity, can be ruled out, for the aforementioned reasons. Therefore, if a hierarchy relates existence to Being, then it is either the case Being contains existence, or existence contains Being.

In one way, when we say a _thing exists_ we mean that a _thing_ can be located at particular place, at a particular time. It exists by virtue of its encounterability in the world. In this formulation, existence is an _instantiation_ of a category of _thingness_, a projection from possibility-space to real-space. But what is it that _the thing_ acquires in crossing the boundary between the possible and the real? One is tempted to postulate matter, the stuff of material, as what separates existence from possibility, but before including this postulate in our canon, we continue the clarification of the term _existence_.

In another way, we say things, such as triangles, exist. But in this sense, existence has a transitive property, for the existence of triangles is necessitated by the existence of more primitive terms, namely lines and angles and these from more primitive terms still, such as extension and curvature, and the operations thereof used to combine them. The existence of triangles is dependent on the existence of the axioms used to construct its concept, so that when we claim the existence of a triangle, ultimately our claim is reduced to the existence of it constituents.

In truth, these two aspects of existence lead back to each other. When the aforementioned transitive property of existence is applied to the natural world and we claim a _thing_ exists, the proposition, as properly understood, is a claim about the actual components of the _thing_, that is, there is an existent underlying the thing. In seeking to find the primary _thing_, the _thing_ upon which all other existences are based, we are led down a series of divisions, segrating the _thing_ into its components, until its components become nothing but pure existence. At some point, the end of this series leads to particles, to quanta of attributes (i.e. mass, charge, spin, position, velocity, etc.), these attributes being the "stuff" of existence. 

There is yet another way we talk of existence that is not reducible to the previous two definitions. We say things like _the number one exists_ and mean something else entirely different from the preceding. The argument that numbers are property of things, that is to say, that a number is always applied to a particular instancing of existents, i.e. three oranges, a dozen jurors, a million citizens, is fallacious in the following way. If number were an attribute of things, or atleast their aggregation, then number could not exceed the totality of existent things, or atleast the totality of possible things. If the number of (possible) things is finite, the absurdity is shown by adding one to their sum. If the number of things is infinite, the absurdity is shown by asking in how many ways the things which exist can be ordered, that is to say, we have here a number not included in the supposed infinity of things, of which number is supposedly an attribute. 

This contradiction shows either the existence of number is independent of the thing whose existence it quantifies, for how else can a collection of things be ordered except by a number which exceeds their quantity, or that existence contains a dimension of numerability not reducible to quantity. If the latter were the case, universal statements, such as _all whales are mammals_ would not possible, for it would not be enough to identify a thing as a whale to conclude it is a mammal, but the order in which it appears in the totality of whales would emerge as an additional condition which must be ascertained before the truth of the proposition could be judged. That this is not the case, i.e. knowing _all whales are mammals_ is sufficient to determine whether this particular whale is a mammal, leads us to conclude number is separate from the physical matter it quantifies. 

The existence of number is always thus, separable and distinct from the existence of things which are enumerated. In this way, existence can be said to be beyond the things, i.e. the substance or matter, to which it also applies. We have here our first ballast by which to divide Being from existence: in the realm of Number, there always exists a thing which can not be, by virtue of ordering. In mathematics, these numbers are known as ordinal numbers.

TODO 

What is it in our Being that prevents the complete quantification of all numbers? Why is it that our Being is not sufficiently _large enough_ to contain every type of number that exists? If we are always restricted to a particular ordering of things, what is it that stops our Being from overflowing and encapsulating this ordering so that it might be ordered along with all the rest? The answer is that _Being is not infinite_. A condition for the actualization of the next ordinal number that orders not only all things that exist but the order in which they exist is an infinity upon which to map that next ordinal. 

If there were no Death, Being would have the capacity to be complete with respect to the things that are possible, so that possibility would no longer be a thing with any meaning. That we die removes certain possibilities from the possibility of ever attaining actualization. 

the inability of human mathematics to capture the totality of numbers in finite symbols is a manifestation of this fundamental truth.

**The Dyads of Substance/Form, Noumena/Phenomena, Res Extensa/Res Cognitans**

In attempting to define a thing as existence, we have passed by its Being entirely. For if the Being of a table was reducible to its existence, i.e. its chemical composition, then it should not occur that separate existents should be separate tables, that is to say, if Being were identical to existence, a steel table would be a wholly different Being from the tree stump offered to the midday travellers as their lunch table. It is, however, the case that a table can exist through different mediums and retain its "table-ness", so that in the account of only its physical properties, we do not touch upon at all what it is that defines a table. 

These ambiguities between Being and existnce no doubt result from double duty _is_ performs in our language. For when we say a _thing is_, we typically mean a _thing exists_, where as when we say a _thing is this_, we should understand this proposition as a proposition about its Being. 
  
TODO 

Matters are complicated with the introduction of time, for now a thing no longer simply _is_, but contains a multitude of ways of coming to be: _is_, _was_, _will be_, _has been_. With this terminology, it becomes clear Being intrinsically contains a dimension of time and space, so that Being is said to be with respect to time and with respect to space. 

TODO

The first philosophical analysis of Being of which we are aware comes down to us through the Greek tradition. **Aristotle**, in particular, living more than two thousand years ago, synthesized the works of all that preceded into a single train of though. Despite the age of his works, they have remained throughout history a source of considerable study, in particular his contributions to the so-called _primary_ philosophy, what would be called today _ontology_, the study of Being itself. The essence of his contributions to untangling of the puzzle of Being are chiefly found in _Physics_ and _Metaphysics_. 

The essential problem is this: A being is on one hand a substance, a material, matter. On the other hand, it is a multiplicity of _things_. A thing is at once a substance and a representative of something beyond the subtance. For instance, wood is a substance that assumes the form of a table or a chair. In either case, a different thing _becomes_ from the same underlying substance, yet the form of the substance differentiates the _things_ in their thinghood.

The substance signifies through its form its inclusion in a _category_ of Being. This wood _is_ a table; the substance _is_ a thing. But in this, there is, as **Aristotle** was wont to say a puzzle (_aporia_); for a substance can _be_ many things; the table _is_ brown; the table _is_ three feet high; the table _is_ where meals happen. In each of these _beings_, there is an element of _coincidence_, where the particular thing, the table, need not have these _attributes_. Because of this, there is a _category_ demarcating a space of attributes, of the complete enumeration of possibilities of a given substantial form, encompassing the _being_ of a table, in all its multivariate ways. Being is, in Aristotelian physics, the becoming of Form through Substance. 

In this division between Substance and Form, there is a trap that is perhaps impossible to avoid, for it perplexed a millenia of philsophers until the time of **Heidegger**. With the Aristotelian dyad of Substance and Form, we have the beginnings of the so-called mind-body dualism, which was properly synthesized as a framework by **Descartes**, that posits two modes of Being, mapping roughly one-to-one with substance and form, the _res extensa_ and the _res cogitans_, the Being of the physical and the Being of the mental. 

It is this system of thought that mathematizes the physical as pure extension and duration. All things are ordered pairs of attributes and the universe is determined via the changing relationships of its parts. In other words, the _res extensa_, the Being of substance, is a volume of space changing with respect to time. 

The _res cogitans_ is separate from this substance, in the way that we mean it _is_ _about_ the substance. In other words, the Being of the mental, because it _is not_ substance, is _insubstantial_. In this way, we cannot properly say a table _is_ a table at all, for a table is a mental construct on top of the physical Being of matter, so we must rather say, in a "scientific way", its physical counterpart is all that is, and all other designations are purely subjective. The thing which we call a table is in reality reduced to natural forces operating on the world-substance; it is a mathematical equilibrium, or atleast temporarily so. 

There is an element of truth in this interpretation. How could there not be? It is this insight into the nature of Being that led to great revolutions of mathematics and science seen in the eighteenth and nineteenth century. Yet, we must admit, with respect to our phenomenal experience, this description is somehow lacking. With this interpretation, the table is a table because the Being of the mental designates it so, not because it _is_ a table. If we recall a table need not be constructed by human hand to be a table, for a tree stump or any elevated surface would serve the function just as well, the puzzle becomes clearer. 

We here recall the immortal words of the Bard, "A rose by any other name would smell just as sweet." 

TODO

There is yet another way a thing is said to be and that is through the linguistic form of _am_. The notion of _am_ is no general one to be affixed to an indefinite object, for this Being symbolizes a different type of Being altogether: the first person singular present tense. If language is a set of tools by which we represent ideas, _am_ is an orthogonality to the representative dimensions defined by the other forms of _to be_, in that it is a form that by necessity requires a conscious subject, a prior not previously required in the semantics of Being.

Likening a proposition to a function, we draw a parallel to mathematics: a function only has meaning over a certain domain in which it makes sense for its operations to be applied; or, from the surjective direction, we may say a certain domain and its projection define the meaning of a function (as Fourier showed, by reducing all functions on a certain interval to infinite series of trigonometric functions, that in aggregate sum to the functions' range), so that if we say _the function which is defined by the mapping between the set of things which do not exist and the set of natural numbers_, in some way we have defined what is meant by the notion of zero through this mapping and we may, in some sense, say the meaning of zero is _contained_ in the mapping. 

TODO

Likewise, the linguistic notion of _am_ brings with it a certain domain and a certain projection, which clarify its meaning, for the _(x,y)_ in the propositional function _x am y_ cannot be arbitrarily assigned over the space of subject-nouns, over the set of existent things. _Am_ defines a precise and particular subject: _us_. Specifically, _I_. 

This can be seen in the syntactical error that arises in the proposition _the thing am this_; the meaning of _am_ is only understood through _I am this_.

### The Significance of Number with Respect to Conceptualization

We have seen in the previous section that the phenomenon of numerability admits of numbers whose existence cannot have Being, specifically no matter the order of Being, there will always exist a certain class of number, denoted _transfinite_ in the language of **George Cantor**, which exceeds the order of all that is. These numbers are sometimes called _ordinal_ numbers, to make obvious these numbers emerge through the phenomenon of _ordering_ and are opposed to the _cardinal_ numbers which emerge through the phenomenon of _enumeration_. Numberability is thus composed of those two ontological dimensions, order and count, whereas in our everyday dealings we typically associate numerability with only the latter feature of count. To understand the nature of numbers, one must consider both of its aspects. 

What, then, is meant by the Being of numbers, that which exists with the possibility of non-Being? That numbers are, in some sense, is obvious in the declarations _this is one_, _this is two_, etc., made while counting a set of objects, such as coins or sheep or planets.

Yet for all of that, we must not be led astray into viewing numbers as something _physical_, or that which possesses _substance_. We do not encounter numbers directly in our experience; numbers are not phenomenal insofar that we can not approach or touch them and have a sensation regarding their texture or shape. There is never an absolute instance of a number that we perceive in our senses. Rather, we say we encounter numbers _through_ the perception of objects and the number we ascribe to a particular constellation of objects is dependent on the structure we impose on that constellation, on the way we partition the objects participating in the structure into its various constituent sets of objects. 

For example, we may say _one hand_ has _five fingers_. Or, to make the multiplicity of number apparent, we may _there is one car_, but we may also say, _there is four wheels_, _there is two axels_, _there is six windows_, etc.  In none of these cases have we said anything factually inaccurate, but in each case we have ascribed a different number to the same underlying _thing_. In this way, we mean the Being of number, its predication of the subject, i.e _is two_, _is three_, etc., is dependent on the structure of the subject. 

The Being of numbers is fundamentally different from the Being of objects; The Being of a number is a property of the structure of Being. This is what **Alain Badiou** meant when he declared _"mathematics is ontology"_[^Badiou#1]: that to understand how a thing is and to understand what it is that makes a thing a thing, we need mathematics. We will return to **Badiou**'s pronouncment in a little while, after we have the tools to understand why, strictly speaking, he was wrong. Mathematics is not ontology, mathematics _is metaphysics_, but we get ahead of ourselves.

**The Formal Foundations of Number**

---

The first attempt to formalize the notion of a number was made by **Gottlob Frege**. A lifelong project, it found its purest expression in his seminal _Foundations of Arithmetic_[^Frege#1]. In his work, he provides a basis for understanding what a number is, through an analysis of the terms `object`, `concept` and `existence`. 

Returning to the concept of concept, the concept is an abstraction on top of the phenomenon, an ingression into our perception of a commonality over and above what is apparent, i.e. the "_moons of Earth_" is an abstraction over the correspondence and persistence in our sense impression of light reflected over an object falling on our retina. The appearance in our perception is not the concept, it is "_gestalt_", a mere phenomenon. Upon conceptualization, it makes ingress into the metaphysical, or it makes manifest the metaphysical.  It is in metaphysical "_space_" where we formulate propositions such as 

> P = 1 belongs to the concept "moons of Earth"
> Q = 8 belongs to concept "moons of Jupiter"

It is there, in "metaphysical space",  where we can make assertions such as "_P is true_" versus "_Q is false_". That the form to which the assertion attaches refers to something found or not found in our Being is incidental to its form. The truth of the form is not found in the form, or else appearance would be the ultimate reality.

That these propositions becomes assertions is evident only in their reference to something that is found its Being in the world, i.e. **Frege**'s `bedeutung`. However, that the form to which the assertion attaches refers to something found in Being is incidental to its form. Only in the self-evident form does truth obtain regardless, otherwise the truth of the form is not found in the form, or else appearance would be the ultimate reality. The truth of non-self-evident propositions is ascertained via their `contingency`, their descent from the metaphysical into the physical, or if your prefer, via a process of _transcedence_. A proposition is only metaphysical in the sense that is conceivable to suppose _P_ were not the case, i.e. a world where Earth has two moons. The metaphysical proposition _P_ becomes physical with respect to Being, when its assertion obtains Truth, i.e. there exists a world where Earth has one moon versus there does not exist a world where Earth has one moon. Truth, or more generally judgement, is the bridge between metaphysical and physical, between the possibility of form, i.e. its existence, and its Being. 

In this way, **Frege** examines the proposition "_all whales are mammals_" to point out the metaphysical `subordination` inherent to conceptualization, i.e. the concept of whales is contained in the concept of mammals. This proposition does not reveal anything about `Being-in-the-world`, for "even assuming that the (thing which is phenomenally present with us to which we attach the symbol of) whale is present, our proposition asserts nothing about it. We cannot infer from it that the animal present is a mammal, without the additional proposition that it is a whale, as to which our proposition says nothing"[^Frege#2] In other words, the propositions quantifies over all whales, but makes no assertion about the creature now before us. If we but had that one foothold, we might thus give "_mammals_" qualified metaphysical status, for the truth of "_mammals_" would obtain regardless of its Being, i.e. it would free itself from `contingency` and become eternal. But the concept of "_mammals_" is not like this, for it is a concept dependent on the unique history of the world.

TODO

What **Frege** is arguing is that Number is a concept without `contingency`, i.e. a metaphysical tautology. Number is something that is always true because it exists without reference to Being. Number is something that arrives through Being, but is independent of Being, except insofar that it is what the representations of certain Beings are about. Number is a metaphysical orthogonality in existence, an absolute metric that scales and ascribes itself to particular existents.

To approach the metaphysical nature of Number from a different angle, consider how it is we apprehend five fingers and one hand simultaneously, via its appearance as appendage. The thing simply _is_; Number provides order from above, as it were. The perceptions of five fingers and one hand are coincident, but the conceptions are not. Or, if you prefer **Kantian** language, the appearances overlap, but the phenomena are distinct.

Thus, we might say enumeration is a "_phenomenon_" revealed over and above appearance, and thus call it _epiphenomenal_, if this term were not loaded with materialistic and psychological undertones and anyway implies, through the false syllogism of etymology that is not reflected in the reality of logic, its dependence on the existent world. Instead, we say enumeration is metaphysical to denote its truth without `contingency`, i.e. a number is true regardless of what perceptions we have, what world we find ourselves in and how we are in that world. This is not to be mistaken with the `contingency` that determines the multiple ways a thing can be quantified, depending on the unit used to divide it.

TODO

The conceptualization of objects is the essential metaphysical process. Metaphysics is the inquiry into the properties of this process.

TODO

Throughout the pages of his paper, he defines the numbers _0_ and _1_ in a few different ways. We turn now to his first attempt at capturing, within the confines of representation, the logical definitions of the two simplest numbers,[^Frege#3]

---

**Definition of Zero, version 1**
> The number 0 belongs to a concept if, whatever object considered, the proposition holds universally this object does not exist in that concept.

**Definition of One, version 1**
> The number 1 belongs to a concept if, whatever object considered, the proposition does not hold universally this object does not exist in that concept.
 
---

TODO

**Frege**, ever precise, goes on to reformulate these defintions with more rigor, thus revealing a fundamental principle of metaphysics, to be summarized shortly,

---
**Definition of Zero, version 2**

> The number 0 is the Number which belongs to the concept _not identical with itself_

**Definition of One, version 2**

> The number 1 is the Number which belongs to the concept _identical with 0_

We may instead prefer to express these definitions symbolically using the author's own MarkDown variant of modern set builder notation,

---
**Definition of Zero, version 3**

> A = { x | x != x } <-> n(A) = 0


**Definition of One, version 3**

> B = { x | x = n(A) } <-> n(B) = 1

See [appendix for symbol definitions](./A0_appendix.md)

---

TODO

With these definitions in hand, it then remains to show the cardinality of set _A_ is zero, and that should be self-evident from its definition, i.e. the set that asserts self-identity is impossible is empty, and thus we have the mathematical (_metaphysical_) basis of 0 and 1.

The reader should draw his or her attention to the recursive nature of the concept contained in the definition of 0 and how it embodies _self-evidence_; by _self-evident_ we mean a thing that demonstrates its own truth, a thing whose truth is not in question no matter what conditions obtain, i.e. a truth without `contingency`. The propositional form of _self-evidence_ involves an object, _x_, about which it is an expression. This relation recursively points back to _x_ and violates the conditions of its existence, i.e. its `contingency`. In other words, **Frege** realized the form of _self-evidence_ is contradiction and its denial, i.e. denial of a _self-evidently_ contradictory concept is equivalent to stating its cardinality equals zero. It is not self-evident that "_the rock is heavy_" is true, but it is self-evident "_the rock is not the rock_" is false, because we do not need a reference to anything but the form of the proposition to say it is not so. In essence, **Frege** is attempting to build his edifice on a _negative_ tautology, a contradiction. The basis of his entire project is that contradictions cannot exist. Logic, as it were, has an opinion of itself, namely that its contradictions are empty. 

Take note: the form of the contradiction is irrelevant. We could just as well define zero as the cardinality of the negation of the excluded middle. In either case, there is an inherent feature to any form we substitute into this set theoretic definition of zero: it contains a circular relation. The relation thus expressed will always involve an expression of x and a relation that cannot result in a judgement of truth. In **Frege**'s formulation this expression is the inability of a thing to be itself. Furthermore, all subsequent numbers can be expressed via the recursion back to the original proposition about the cardinality of contradictions.

Within these two definitions, **Frege** has provided an immediately comprehensible and clearly logical way of defining Number as that which makes an assertion about the _cardinality_ of sets of existent things, i.e. the numerability of existent things that fall under a concept. The profundity of this should not be ignored, for what **Frege** has shown here is Number is metaphysical, i.e. Number is not a property _of_ a thing, strictly speaking, but a property _about_ things.

TODO

Frege wanted to make clear the distinction between the existence of numbers and the `factical` origin of numbers, i.e. the psychological abstraction that occurs in the human brain when processing sense data representing a collection of objects.

The sensory impression of a carton of eggs does not contain in and of itself the concept of twelve because of the dozen eggs contained in it no more than it does the concept of one because of the single carton in it; our experience is the immediate apprehension of the world in _gestalt_, in a way that tells us what _is_ before us and with us in the world: the concept enters in this picture in parallel to our awareness of the world; the concept is a dimension available to us through Being, that discloses to us aspects of Being, but is not in and of itself found in Being.

Each of us comes to the table, in the coincidentally literal _and_ figurative sense, with an innate understanding of what it means _to be_. We do it, _be_ that is, without so much as thought. In fact, this is the first point we should make in this section's analysis: Being doesn't require thought. Consciousness is not the determinative factor in our ability to be. This proposition runs counter to the conventional wisdom of the modern world, conditioned as it is by the emergence of machine learning and statistical models and the opinions of these algorithmic processes that view them as the forerunner to artificial intelligence, for we assume in narrating these facts that an artifical intelligence must also be conscious, misled perhaps by the label "_intelligence_". Intelligence, the author believes, comes later; we should understand these emerging fields as the precursor to _artificial Being_, if such an adjective can even be applied to a concept like Being.

The true nature of Being can be seen in its extremities, when it forced in an unsustainable mode. This is most apparent in experiences of great pain or ecstasy, when the self drains away, abstraction melts into concrete reality and we are left with the raw sensous impressions of experience itself; in these moments, the world narrows down to the immediate, to what is directly at hand and readily apparent in our senses. One need only attempt a calculus problem after shattering a femur to attest to the truth of this; It is only with tremendous effort the self can be reclaimed in moments such as these, and it is these stories we make legend, for resisting temptation in pursuit of a higher goal or ceasing to die in the face of Death until your purpose is fulfilled are the highest mark a Being can attain. These themes speak to us because they return us to a primordial state, before considerations of consciousness crowd out all others, and show what the self really is: a struggle to sustain itself despite the incessant efforts of nature it to its primary state of Nothing.

Consciousness is an abstraction that requires the concept of self and the concept of self is only apparent on reflection, when the commonality of recollected memory points to a convergence behind the forms of our body, i.e. the realization that all memories originate from _our_ body. The modern world does much to reinforce this notion from the moment of our birth, from the attachment of a name to an infant to the way parents rise to satiate an infant's needs and so teach it how to affect the world, all of this leads us to assume our self is primary; we must not be led by our conditioning to conclude this. We must acknowledge the "I" is derivative; there is an awareness inherent to _Being_ that precedes and conditions it. We often relive our memories as stories, narrating our thoughts, but this is a learned practice; beneath this, there is a more primal substrata, where the actual sense impression of the moment in question is drawn close to the surface of experience so that a memory can _almost_ be felt again; a lover's infinite embrace or the impossibly cold flesh of a dead child or a gasp of heartrending joy, these are memories that exist in fragments, without narrative structure, that stand as headstones for moments passed from Being, to be summoned like arcane incantations before the mind's eye so that they may be felt again, but in a degenerate way, for they are markers of what was, not what is. 

A darkness exists before we think, when we have not yet become ourselves and yet remain in the presence of the world, a Being entire, without reference to itself except as a conduit for experience. It is this `a priori` mode of Being, where the necessary and essential forms of Being are imposed on it, namely that of time and space and causality, that conditions our `a posteriori` reflective Being, i.e. our ability to generalize across form and conceptualize objects into abstract concepts.

This is how **Kant** re-conceptualized the problem of Being: A Being does not come to be through existence, but through the appearance of existence, the representations of the existents that arise in perception. Thus we have the famous distinction between `noumena` and `phenomena`, existence versus appearance. For **Kant**, the `noumenon` exists beyond the `phenomenon`, its interiority as an object-thing inaccessible in itself.

We need only reflect on this to acknowledge, if not its absolute truth, then its approximate truth. For instance, we know now, hundreds of years after **Kant**'s time, of the existence of wavelengths on the electromagnetic spectrum imperceptible to the human eye, frequencies of sound imperceptible to the human ear, etc. **Kant** is saying: There are things _out there_ that exist beyond our ability to _be_ with them in a direct manner.

Our Being in the world is phenomenal, we experience it through the apprehension of form, through the differentiation of objects in the sense data. The necessity of form is broken across the dimensions of time, space and causality; to be precise in our language, form is a becoming in space over time linked through causality; these are orthogonal directions that cannot be reduced to one another; all Being is the Being of the form through these axes. However, form only _exists for us_, the subjects. It is a prior we impose upon the world in order to understand it. There can be Nothing in this world with us what we do not first have the potential of understanding as a possible Being in this world. Our representations of the `noumena`, the thing-in-itself, that exist through space and time, are therefore relative to our ability to know them. 

That we have come to realize our apparent perceptions do not encompass the scope of our so-called phenomenal Being, however, shows in what way this is an approximate truth. That we may infer the presence of ultraviolet radiation, for instance, presupposes that ultraviolet radiation is in the world with us in some capacity, ready to approach and apprehend through the appearances in sense data, but in an indirect manner, through the process of _indication_. If its initial appearance is deceptive, that does not mean a fissure has slipped between the crevice of appearance and existence via some impassable Cartesian boundary, but rather that appearance may be an indication, or a signification, of something which it is not. 

**Martin Heidegger** proposed in _Being and Time_ a distinction in the meanings we attach to the word _appearance_, for there are actually several subordinate concepts lurking in this supra-concept that need further elaboration before a proper understanding is had. There is that which reveals itself as that which it is, in an immediate way; We call this _actual appearance_. And then there is that which indicates through its _actual appearance_ that which it is not; we call this _indicative appearance_. 

Before introducing **Heidegger**'s further refinement in **Kant**'s conception of _appearance_, we first pause and examine the distinction between _actual_ versus _indicative_ appearance he offers us. The concept can be clearly seen in the object of traffic signs, for instance, a stop sign. A stop sign has an actual appearance of a red octagon, but it indicates, or _stands for_, something which it is not, namely the concept of halting an automobile before proceeding beyond some imaginary line imposed in space. We may, in our Being with the stop sign, approach it in either mode, _actual_ or _indicative_, and in each mode, apprehend it in an entirely different manner. 

The _actual appearance_ of an object in the senses has been called many things by many different people. We have already seen its muddled, yet insightful, origin in **Kant** via the `phenomenon`-`noumenon` dyad. We have seen several senses of the word offered by **Heidegger**, and will return to his further distinctions in the following paragraphs. Here we give brief space to the terminology adopted by other prominent philosophers, who recast the problem in different language in order to _indicate_ the important objects of analysis. **Alfred Whitehead** called the subject of which we speak a _prehension_, to distinguish it from a _com_prehension, i.e. the object becomes in our Being in an immediate way, before it is it conceptualized by the intellect. **Arthur Schopenhauer** called it _representation_. TODO
 
In the case of an object's _indicative appearance_, we may see the multifoliate variations that arise through the concept of _indication_ in the following example. Consider how different individuals may understand the presence of a stop sign in their preception: the motorist sees an instruction to apply force to the brake pedal; the artist on foot the stark red contrasted against the dull, boring grey of concrete; the engineer lines of force counteracted by bolts; a bureaucrat the regulations governing its procurement and acquisition; the thoughtless pedestrian an indeterminate shape in their periphery. In each of these cases, the "lines" of indication emanating from the stop sign to the world encompassing it are presupposed by the apprehending subject. 

**Arthur Schopenhauer** built on **Kant**, positing the world as the subjective representation of objects. The world of objects exists for the subject, but only insofar as the subject exists for the object.
