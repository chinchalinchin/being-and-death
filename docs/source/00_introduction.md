# Preface

The selection of a title for this work has gone through several revisions:

- _Death_
- _The Phenomenology of Death_
- _The Ontology of Death_
- _Towards an Ontology of Death_
- _A Critique of Being_
- _The Death in Philosophy_
- _The Death of Philosophy_
- _The Philosopher's Suicide Note_
- _Solipsism and Inevitability_
- _The Misanthropy of Being_
- _The Misanthropy in Being_
- _The Horror of Death_
- _The Horror in Death_
- _Horror_
- _The Descent of Being_ 
- _The Twisting of the Screw_

Of these, the only one the author truly feels remorse for not selecting is the last. If the reader should find the current title lacking, perhaps they will find solace in this alternative, _The Twisting of the Screw_, as the author feels simply reading this is sufficient to understand the contents it encloses. 

The current title, _Being and Death_, is meant as an allusion to those monoliths of philosophy few people claim to have read and even less to have understood, e.g. _Being and Time_, _Being and Nothingness_, _Being and Event_, _Process and Reality_, etc. The author unfortunately counts himself among the former group, but lacks the hubris to claim membership to the latter. In this, there lurks the motivation for what the reader now finds in their hands. By putting his thoughts to paper, the author sought to understand what it is these authors were getting at and in doing so believes he has found a problem lurking in their formulations. This work is an attempt to elaborate that problem. It should be clear, even at this early stage and without further ado, what that problem is, in the estimation of the author.

Some of the titles not selected have been used as the headings of sections and subsections, indicating the scope of the current project outstripped the author's original intent. For that, he apologizes. If he knew at the beginning all of this would amount to so many countless words no one will ever read or understand (<sup><sub>the author being at the top of both lists</sub></sup>), he probably still would have written them, but done so with more evident despair and less gravitas. 

If the author is granted one contribution to the annals of philosophy, let it be the proof of the futility of all future philosophies. Forever after let us cast the would-be philosophers from great heights to end their miserable lives on the rocks below. If that be too ambitious, then let the contribution be atleast as a footnote affixed to everything that follows: "_Caution: you may die reading this_" 

In constructing such a proof, we shall adhere to the grand tradition of philosophy and arbitrarily capitalize some concepts and not others to denote their precise meaning in the following discourse, foremost among these: _Being_, _Nothing_, _Other_ and _Death_. We do this for no other reason but because, in the inimitable words of the twentieth century's greatest philsopher, **Bill Waterson**, we "_must obey the inscrutable exhortions of (the) soul_".

If the preceding lacks clarity, then let us rephrase more flippantly, in the hopes colloquialism will excite in the reader an appropriate vision of what is to come: _philosophy should tremble before the horror of Death as we do_.

And the end of all our exploring
Will be to arrive where we started
And know the place for the first time
