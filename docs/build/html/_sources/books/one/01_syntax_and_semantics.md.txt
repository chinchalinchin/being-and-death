# The Syntactic Structure and Semantic Meaning of Being

The project of philosophy is to make clear what we are, to present for the understanding the concepts which underlie our Being, the Being that occurs when some small pocket of the world turns on the rest and declares itself separate by the proclamation, _I am_. Philosophy should, in its rightful endeavor, provide the basis for understanding how this situation, that of the _am_, comes to be separate from the other types of Being, if that indeed is what is occuring. In essence, philosophy, if it is not to go the way of alchemy or phrenology, must answer the question: _what am I_?. Furthermore, it must does so in a way that distinguishes itself from the fields of pure logic, mathematics or physics. Whether or not philsophy is up to the task is the question currently at hand. 

When asking _what am I?_, we necessarily bring with us an expectation the answer will assume the form _I am x_, or some essential variatian thereof, so that in order to answer this question we must first understand what type(s) of operands may be substituted for _x_  in the above and remain intelligible. We must also stash in the back of our thoughts the creeping notion that it may be the case there is no expression, within the structured forms of linguistic representation, that is capable of answering this question. We shall grant an answer is possible for the moment in order to see where it might lead, in which case, if there is to be an answer to the question _what am I?_, it must necessarily be of the form _I am x_, for the _what_ in the question seeks a solution of the form _x_, of a _thing_ to be determined. 

The type of proposition represented by _I am x_ is a particular case of a more general symbolic proposition, one that can be uncovered by recognizing _am_ is a derivative of the same root as _is_ (more on this tacit assumption to follow shortly), so that _I am x_, which might be rephrased more verbosely as _that which is me is x_, is really governed, at least in the limit, by the same algebra that governs simpler primitive terms captured symbollically by  _this is x_. We thus must preface our answer to _what am I?_ with an answer to _what is this?_.

Before doing so we clarify a few things. 

## Relativizers and the Relative That

The use of _that_ in the preceding _that which is me_ is to be understood as a linguistic [relativizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativizer), and not the indicative _that_ which opposes the _this_. It is the _that_ identified in the construction _this is something that is useful_ as opposed to the _that_ identified in the construction _that is something_. In the latter case, the _that_ is a quantification, a particular case, a _thing_. In the former case, the _that_ is no _thing_, but a way of nesting a relation of Being contained in the secondary predicate, _is useful_, so that its content flows back to the subject whose Being was previously indicated, the _this_ which is _something_. 

The role played by _that_ in a _relativizer_ has the same structure as the _that_ used in that indicative sense, in that it encapsulates its operand into a single unit and binds together its multiplicites so as to ready it for substitution into the conjunctive form. But whereas the indicative _that_ gathers the subject for the operation of the predicate, the relative _that_ reflects back its predicate onto the subject of its attached proposition.

The construction _this is something that is useful_ is logically equivalent to the conjunction of the separate propositions _this is something_ and _something is useful_. There is, however, a subtle difference in meaning. The conjunction of propositions implies its components are atomic, that is to say, both _this is something_ and _something is useful_ are separate propositions that attain a new meaning when conjoined, whereas the relativized statement unit the distinct parts into a continuous whole, so that is properties may not be separated. 

The _relativizer_ and the relative _that_ are useful devices, but whether or not they are necessary grammatical forms is not so apparent. _Here is something that is useful_ may be replaced in almost all cases to the similar form _here is something useful_. Colloquially, the phraseologies are near enough equivalent that they may be treated the same, but the question remains on the philosophical level if the difference is an artifact of linguistic ambiguity and inconsistency or if a _relativizer_ deserves a special place in the grammar of Being. 

The _relativizer_ exists in the oldest languages of which we still have historical documentation. It plays a central role, for instance, in the name early humans gave to God. In the opening books of the Torah, within the text of **Exodus**, God reveals his true name to Moses on Mount Sinai[^Torah#1], 

> And Moses said unto God: 'Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them: The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me: What is His name? what shall I say unto them?'

> And God said unto Moses: 'I AM THAT I AM'; and He said: 'Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel: I AM hath sent me unto you.'

God's reply to Moses, derived from Hebrew,

> אֶהְיֶה (ehyé) אֲשֶׁר (’ăšer) אֶהְיֶה (ehyé)

has been translated numerous ways: _I am that I am_, _I am what I am_, _I am what am_, _I am that am_, _I am who am_. 

The Hebrew word, אֶהְיֶה, is the first person singular of the infinitive הָיָה, pronounced phonetically as "hâyâh", which translates as _to be, become, come to pass, exist, happen, fall out_[^Strong#1]. Modern Hebrew conjugates God's reply in the future tense, i.e. _I will be what I will be_. However Hebrew at the time did not differentiate tenses. There was no difference, atleast grammatically speaking, in Ancient Hebrew between the notions of _will be_, _has been_ and _is now_. 

The term, אֲשֶׁר, is the semantic device known as a _relativizer_ just discussed. Quite literally, the Hebrew Torah states, God is the _am that am_, where _that_ is understood as a nesting operation, where the Being on the right hand side of the _relativizer_ is ascribed to the Being on the left hand side in addition to its own Being.

The name Judaism gave to God, _Yahweh_, understood through the so-called [tetragrammaton](), in one intrepretation could be seen as an attempt by early humans to distinguish what they are from what is, that is to say, as a way to differentiate the _am_ from the _is_. The choice of first person singular, as opposed to the impersonal third person, is telling in this respect, for it is a claim about the Being of God, namely that God is in the same way the subject of _I am_ is. 

Our first inclination to the divine, as it has come down to us, was an expression of what is meant by our Being, identifying it as equivalent to the Being of the divine. _Yahweh_ is to be understood, in this interpretation, as an assertion that _am_ is distinct from _is_, that what we are is more than what is given to us.  

According to our ancestors' account, God is what _I am_. God is the **Cartesian** _sum_. Interpretted in the literal sense, this account of the divine identifies our type of Being, the Being that is contained in (or revealed by) the I's _am_, as a a separate sort of Being from that of other Beings, and this separateness is exactly what gives rises to the classification of the divine.

**Descartes** himself employs the _relativizer_ in his famous _Discourse_ when he attempts to answer the question _what am _I_. As expected, his answer is of the form _I am x_, but with the aid of a _relativizer_, he is able to add a layer of complexity to the answer, essentially hiding details in the indeterminate form of _x_ with the appropriate use of a relative _that_. _I am a thing that has thoughts_, he replies, "_I was a substance the whole essence or nature **of which** is to think_"[^Descartes#1]

For the final confirmation of the validity of the relative _that_ as an ontological relation, we turn to mathematics. In the primitive symbols of set theory, the function of the _relativizer_ can be seen in the `|` that designates the variables over which a proposition is quantified. For example, the `axiom of abstraction` given in the following symbolic proposition,[^Appendix#1]

`#y | [ @x | x ~ y & P(x) ]`

can be translated into English as _there exists a y **such that** for all x **such that** if and only if x belongs to y, then x has the property P_. The obtuse translation is meant to draw the attention to the analogous role of the `|` and the relative _that_. 

It would seem in trying to answer what we are, a single relation of Being is insufficient and _that_ such answers require grammatical tools _that_ allow for Being to flow recursively through a sentence. We thus revise our expectation of the answer to _what am I_ from _ I am x_ to the form _I am x that y_, where _x_ and _y_ are indeterminate variables. 

## Being as a Linguistic Invariant

With the discussion of the _relativizer_ in mind and its unique role played in certain historical answers to the question _what am I_, there is another point to address, one that cannot be skipped over before proceeding. We have, in the previous paragraphs made the assumption the Being of the _am_ is a cousin to the Being of the _is_. We must now turn to an argument raised by **Alfred Tarski**, in which we must consider _"that the semantical concepts have a relative character, that they must always be related to a particular language."_[^Tarski#1] 

It might be the case the conjugation of _to be_ into its derivative forms, _is_ and _am_, is a conceptual union not born out in the facts. When we talk about the Being of _am_ and compare it to the Being of _is_, are we being misled by the language used to express these ideas into supposing a coincidence of meaning where in fact there is none?

This is, in questions involving Being, the central question: whether _what I am_ is of a genre with _what this is_, and moreover whether this mutual origin is linguistic or ontological. If we are to establish any sort of ontological relation between the meaning of these two terms independent of the knowledge granted by language, we must be careful in understanding **Tarski**'s argument. 

In one reading, we might think **Tarski** is saying meaning, i.e. semantical conceptualization, is ephemeral, a property of a system, without use outside of that system. While not entirely inaccurate, the exact meaning is subtler by far, for his argument relies on the notion of _relative_. 

Things are only said to be _relative_ insofar as there is an invariant quantity available to all frames of reference that allows the calculation of by how much the relative quantities in the system have changed. In **Galilean** relativity, the invariant quantity is space and time, so that all motion is relative to immovable space-time; since all frames of reference measure the same lengths and times, motion is able to be viewed relative to either reference without loss of fidelity. In **Einsteinian** relativity, the invariant is the speed of light, so that space and time themselves are relative to this fixed quantity, and frames of reference will adjust their spatial and temporal metrics accordingly to accomodate this constant.

If meaning is determined by the language from which it arose, what is the ultimate invariant quantity to which language itself must conform in order to prescribe a metric for meaning? With careful thought, the answer is obvious. If there is one constant to be found in all the various languages in the world, at any given time in the spoken history of humanity, it is found in the words: _Be, _Ser_, _Sein_, _Shi_, _Desu_, etc. The invariant of language is, of course, Being itself. In the same way the speed of light requires space and time to become the quantities necessary for its correct calculation, Being requires language to become forms which can represent it.

We are thus asking if the conjugation of _am_ deserves recognition as an ontological operation over and above the existential operation of _is_ which structures language, or if it is a redundancy that is already included in _is_ or merely a semantical construct with no meaning outside of language. If the first case obtains, _am_ provides structure distinct from the structure of the _is_, essentially performing the function of dimensionalizing laneguage, and the question _what am I_ has been granted a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for a meaningful answer. If either of thee latter cases obtain, then the answer we seek is clearly some variation of _I am Nothing_.

Insight into this question can be gained by studying the historical origins of Being in our language. Language is an archeological treasure hiding in plain sight, a living autobiography of history. **Ludwig Wittgenstein** likened language to "_an ancienty city: a maze of little streets and squares, of old and new houses, and of houses with additions from various periods; and this surrounded by a multitude of new boroughs with straight regular streets and uniform houses_"[^Wittgenstein#1] In other words, language is not an absolute, but a process, constantly shifting forms and revealing new realms of meaning, but retaining its essential function: that of representation and signification. 

In modern English, _Being_ is the marriage of two concepts that were previously distinct. Its etymology descends from the coupling of the Old English words _beon_ and _wesan_, which can be in turn, if the theorists are to be believed, traced further back to the Proto-Indo-European roots of _bheu_ and _wes_, respectively. For this reason, we conjugate from the infinitive _to be_ _B_-root words _be_, _been_ and _being_ and _W_-root words _was_ and _were_. _Is_, a direct cognate from Old English, is the present tense conjugation of _wesan_, revealing its hereditary from the _es_-stem roots that form the concept of Being in other Proto-Indo-European languages, such as the Spanish _estar_ or TODO. 

It is in the meaning of these words prior to their symbosis we shall find a starting point for understanding the separation of _am_ and _is_. The differences between the semantic function of _beon_ and _wesan_ is slight, but potent.

_Wesan_ is the Being of objects and nouns. It is the _is_ of the _this_ and _that_, the _the_ and the _a_. When affixed to a name, _wesan_ indicates existence, what is actual about its subject. _He is here_, _you will be tired_, _there are three of them_. These are all existential statements of particular cases, facts which can be determined true or false by reference to reality. This type of concrete Being is contained in _wesan_. TODO EXAMPLE TODO
 
To put it succinctly, _wesan_ is the empirical _is_, the _is_ which refers to the external world. _Beon_, however, is the Being of the abstraction and adjectives. _Beon_ indicates an object's [gnomic aspect](TODO:wikilink). In the parlance of logic, a _gnomic_ truth is a universal assertion, a statement of generality that applies to all things of which it speaks. While the Being of modern English does not have a direct _gnomic_ form, a _gnomic_ proposition can be induced by the removal of the particularizing article _the_ in the following: _the birds are fast_. The use of _the_ in this sentence refers to a particular group of birds, whereas the proposition _birds are fast_ does not refer to any definite bird, but references the _gnomic aspect_ of birds, i.e. the abstraction of form common to all avian entities.  It is in this context that _beon_ is conjugated in Old English. TODO EXAMPLE TODO

Mandarin has a similar variation in how it unpacks the relations of Being into representative form. In Mandarin, the verb (literal mandarin) _shi_ can only be affixed to nouns, to signs representing physical objects. (literal mandarin) _Ni shi zhongguo ren_; you are Chinese. However, (literal mandarin) _shi_ cannot be affixed to adjectives, such as beautiful. For that, the extra verb (literal mandarin) _hen_ is required. 

We have here  again in _shi_ and _hen_ the distinction of meaning found in _wesan_ and _beon_, that of actuality versus abstraction. Indeed, this is a common duality to be found in languages across the world. 

When _beon_ and _wesan_ were gradually merged in modern English, two meanings came to inhabit the same word. Still, to this day, it could be argued, these meanings have not yet been fully integrated. There are defects in the merger that can be glimpsed, when words falter slightly in their aspect and _Being_ reveals its separate meanings. The English _Being_ haphazardly applies the ideas of concrete and abstract reality simultaneously, thereby allowing assertions of existence to be mixed with assertions of conceptualization, as seen in the propositions _there is love_, _this is justice_, _we are eternal_. The English _is_ is capable of abstracted existence, existence that is not reducible to objective reality.

## Logical Consistency

It in this muddle of semantics that we are seeking to extract an answer to the question _what am I_. It is at this point we must ask what it is we require of an answer so that we might recognize it as such. 


A novice logician might reply _consistency_, by which is meant the idea that language is really an axiomatic system from which propositions are constructed according to syntactical rules, so that we start with primitives notions like _set_, _element_ and _belong_, then we formalize the semantics of these concepts with quantified propositions such as _there exists a set_ and _some things have the property of belonging to that set_, then we proceed to define more complex notions such as equivalence through the formalized semantics these primitive notions afford, used in conjunction with the laws of logic (modus ponens, syllogism, etc.), e.g.. _if belonging to a first set implies belonging to a second set and if belonging to the second set implies belonging to the first set, then both sets are said to the be equivalent_. 

_Consistency_ is the idea that all such statements thus constructued, if proceeding from a correct set of axioms (possibly infinite in number), will always yield a determinate statement. By determinate, it is meant, given the truth of the axioms, the truth of the statement can be judged purely as a function of syntax. Or put another way, all statements in the system can be reduced to statements about the primitive notions that compose the foundation of the system. In mathematics, all theorems ultimately become theorems about sets, elements and the concept of _belonging_, when the appropriate substitutions are made for the [definien]() in the complex definitions that are built up through the application of syntax (a mathematical function f(x), for instance, can be defined as a mapping of sets to one another). All meaning in the system is built up through the meaning given to the primitive notions, i.e. what a _set_ is, what an _element_ is and what it means for an _element_ to _belong_ to a _set_. The semantics of the system are entirely incapable of saying what it is these primitive notions actually are, for all meaning in the language system comes from what it is they mean, i.e. the concept _equivalence_ is reducible to the concept of _belonging_, but the concept of _belonging_ has no further definition; it is what is simply what is meant by the symbol `~` in `#A | @x | x ~ A v A = 0`^[Appendix#1]. In other words, the meaning of the primitive notions must be given in the intuition before the syntactical consequences of their meaning is dispersed through the structure of the system. Once the primitive meanings are given, the content of that meaning must necessarily follow the rules of syntax. 

Moreover, _consistency_ requires that any statements which are thus formed should _not_ be capable of contradicting any other proposition formed by the same rules of syntax. Given a set of axioms, it should not be the case, for example, the propositions _there is an x that is A_ and _there is an x that is not A_ should mutually exclude the other's possibility. 

TODO 

Here is as good as place as any to give pause to understanding the difference between syntax and semantics. Consider the arguments:

_All mammals are warm-blooded, all whales are mammals, therefore all whales are warmblooded_. 

_If the ball is dropped, then it falls is equivalent to the ball is falling or it has not been dropped_                                                  
These lines of reasoning are syntactical, because they are valid if their content is abstracted away from them, as seen in the following,

_All x are y, all z are x, therefore all z are y._
_if x then y is equivalent to x or not y._

Strictly speaking, we should only speak of truth when the operation of assertion is involved, so we do not say these propositions are true, for that is the purview of the terms which have been abstracted away from them, but rather these propositions provide the syntax for their asserted content to become true.

TODO

A question that is not often addressed in the literature is whether or not an inconsistent system can still be meaningful. 

If a system is complete, then it is inconsistent. But does the inverse hold? If we start from an inconsistent language, does that imply the lacunae of possible meaning in that language is complete?

## Existential versus Abstract Being

TODO

The question of the _am_ is then intricately related to the question of language, and in what way the meaning of the _am_ carries with it the invarance of the _is_ (semantically speaking); that is, in what way the meaning implied by _am_ in language is necessary for language to be language? 

TODO

Separating out the components of the answer to the question _what is this?_, we have in _this is x_ three terms: _this_, _is_, and _x_. The sentence must find its meaning in the meaning of its components. _This_ and _x_ are perhaps the easiest to understand, for they are _existential_ terms. 

_This_ carries with it a unary operation, in that anything thus denoted _this_ becomes a single unit, regardless of its structure. When we say _this is a calculator_, we have amalgamated not only the abstractions of buttons, internal circuitry and plastic casing into a single gestalt, into a single concept, but moreover, we have synthesized the representative forms of color, solidity, extension, etc, into a common form across our senses. _This_ represents the coincidence of forms into conceptual novelty. 

If _this_ is monadic in its application, then _x_ is variadic. Where as the _this_ collasces the different parts participating in the same underlying form, the _x_ disperses the possibility of forms across an infinite range of things. There are many answers to _what is this?_ and in each case the role by the _x_, regardless of its form, remains the same. 

TODO

When we say _a thing is_ and _a thing is this_, we have in mind two different ideas, due to the divergent of Being in English. There is in these two possible applications of _is_ the notions of existence and abstraction, respectively. 

In the former case, the proposition is a claim of existence in general, regardless of its particulars; the proposition _a thing is_ could be restated in equivalent form as _a thing exists_. To achieve the broadest generality and thus bring the full range of meaning into view, we make the subject of the sentence indefinite and say _something is_. 

Allowing the subject of this simple proposition to take on any value, we have arrived at the most elementary proposition that can be expressed in any philosophical framework. It is self-evident, however distorted our perception of the world may be and however uncertain we are of all that we experience, that we can at the very least say, _something is_. What it is this something is, while possibly beyond our ability to comprehend, cannot be Nothing for the simple fact that it _is_. If the world is nothing but illusion, then it _is_ still illusion. 

The **Cartesian** _sum_ is really a particular form of the essential truth _something is_, where the primary state of Being from which all others proceed is assumed to be that of consciousness. The fallacy in this ontological proof _cogito ergo sum_ is the _cogito_ is not primitive; there are truths that precede it in form, namely, the latin _est_, the something which is.

The existence of _something_, of the general thing, is more certain than the I's _am_, because in order to be an _I_, _I_ must first be separate from _something_, _I_ must be differentiated in type and form from the general thing. Therefore, the _something is_ precedes the _I am_. From the thing's general form, the arbitrariness contained in the _some_, we see the _thing_ which _I am not_ that precedes _me_ need not be a particular thing, it need not have any properties except Being distinct from _me_. For this reason, the thing which is prior to _I_ is not necessarily determined in its form; It is only existence, in indeterminate form, that precedes _my_ Being. 

We do not require in this formulation, at this point, that a _thing_'s appearance correspond to its existence, for whether or not things are as they appear is irrelevant with respect to their differentation from _my_ Being. If what I perceive is not what actually is, then it is only because _something is_ that I cannot perceive. Existence must be presupposed before that of consciousness. 

_I_ can not be mistaken for _this thing_, because what _I am_ is not what _that is_. 

TODO


The proposition _a thing is_ says nothing about the ways in which the thing exists, only that it is so, whereas the proposition _a thing is this_ seems to belong to the former case in that it declares not only is it so, but further, it is so in such-and-such a way, so we are easily led to the conclusion the latter is a more particular case of the former. 

TODO

Before drawing that conclusion, let us examine the negation of each, for the relation of the negated parts makes clearer the relation obtaining between the original parts.

When we say _a thing is not_, we mean that it does not exist. With this claim, a _thing_'s potential to be a _thing_ has been removed, except removed absolutely in the sense that it can never be in the first place. We must be careful in the interpretation of this proposition, for we bump against the process of Being when we vaguely apply the rules of conjugation and propose: _this does not exist yet, but it may come to be_ or _this did exist, but now no longer does_. For we have invited the notion of Being in through the backdoors of _does_ and _did_, when what we wanted was to examine the notion of negated existence in isolation. We therefore clarify that by existence we do not mean with respect to time and space, but absolutely in itself. 

As an example, we could say _God is not_, _unconditional love is not_ or _a color without an electromagnetic frequency is not_. When we say _God is not_, we are careful not to include, even in thought, the addition of _here_, i.e. _God is not here_, for that would undo the whole meaning, implying that God might instead be over _there_. _God is not_ is an absolute denial of existence, a removal of possibility from the world entire. 

The negation of _a thing is this_ does not undo the _thingness_ of the subject, but rather the source of its _thingness_. In the negation of this proposition, the existence of the underlying subject _thing_ is not negated; indeed, it is affirmed as an instance of something but not of _this_. _A thing is not this_ does not mean the thing does not exist, but rather that it exists, but is not given by the thing we mean by _this_; we may therefore say _a thing is that_. It is therefore the case the proposition _a thing is not_ is not contained in the proposition _a thing is not this_, for a thing which is not this is still a thing. 

As an example, we could say _God is not this_ and we do not thereby deny his existence, only his particular form. If God is not this, then he must be _that_. Being is a division of existence into what is _this_ versus what is _that_.

In other words, _a thing is this_ and its negation _a thing is not this_ both assume the existence of the underlying thing. The negation of one does not nullify the existence of its subject, so that whatever is meant by _a thing is_ belongs to both _a thing is this_ and _a thing is not this_. Nowhere to be found in either proposition are the effects of _a thing is not_.

This may be seen in another way. If the relation between Being and existence is one of containment, then it is either the case they are identical, a thing exists without being or a thing can be without existing. The first case, that of identity, can be ruled out, for the aforementioned reasons. Therefore, if a hierarchy relates existence to Being, then it is either the case Being contains existence, or existence contains Being.

In one way, when we say a _thing exists_ we mean that a _thing_ can be located at particular place, at a particular time. It exists by virtue of its encounterability in the world. In this formulation, existence is an _instantiation_ of a category of _thingness_, a projection from possibility-space to real-space. But what is it that _the thing_ acquires in crossing the boundary between the possible and the real? One is tempted to postulate matter, the stuff of material, as what separates existence from possibility, but before including this postulate in our canon, we continue the clarification of the term _existence_.

In another way, we say things, such as triangles, exist. But in this sense, existence has a transitive property, for the existence of triangles is necessitated by the existence of more primitive terms, namely lines and angles and these from more primitive terms still, such as extension and curvature, and the operations thereof used to combine them. The existence of triangles is dependent on the existence of the axioms used to construct its concept, so that when we claim the existence of a triangle, ultimately our claim is reduced to the existence of it constituents.

In truth, these two aspects of existence lead back to each other. When the aforementioned transitive property of existence is applied to the natural world and we claim a _thing_ exists, the proposition, as properly understood, is a claim about the actual components of the _thing_, that is, there is an existent underlying the thing. In seeking to find the primary _thing_, the _thing_ upon which all other existences are based, we are led down a series of divisions, segrating the _thing_ into its components, until its components become nothing but pure existence. At some point, the end of this series leads to particles, to quanta of attributes (i.e. mass, charge, spin, position, velocity, etc.), these attributes being the "stuff" of existence. 

There is yet another way we talk of existence that is not reducible to the previous two definitions. We say things like _the number one exists_ and mean something else entirely different from the preceding. The argument that numbers are property of things, that is to say, that a number is always applied to a particular instancing of existents, i.e. three oranges, a dozen jurors, a million citizens, is fallacious in the following way. If number were an attribute of things, or atleast their aggregation, then number could not exceed the totality of existent things, or atleast the totality of possible things. If the number of (possible) things is finite, the absurdity is shown by adding one to their sum. If the number of things is infinite, the absurdity is shown by asking in how many ways the things which exist can be ordered, that is to say, we have here a number not included in the supposed infinity of things, of which number is supposedly an attribute. 

This contradiction shows either the existence of number is independent of the thing whose existence it quantifies, for how else can a collection of things be ordered except by a number which exceeds their quantity, or that existence contains a dimension of numerability not reducible to quantity. If the latter were the case, universal statements, such as _all whales are mammals_ would not possible, for it would not be enough to identify a thing as a whale to conclude it is a mammal, but the order in which it appears in the totality of whales would emerge as an additional condition which must be ascertained before the truth of the proposition could be judged. That this is not the case, i.e. knowing _all whales are mammals_ is sufficient to determine whether this particular whale is a mammal, leads us to conclude number is separate from the physical matter it quantifies. 

The existence of number is always thus, separable and distinct from the existence of things which are enumerated. In this way, existence can be said to be beyond the things, i.e. the substance or matter, to which it also applies. We have here our first ballast by which to divide Being from existence: in the realm of Number, there always exists a thing which can not be, by virtue of ordering. In mathematics, these numbers are known as ordinal numbers.

TODO 

What is it in our Being that prevents the complete quantification of all numbers? Why is it that our Being is not sufficiently _large enough_ to contain every type of number that exists? If we are always restricted to a particular ordering of things, what is it that stops our Being from overflowing and encapsulating this ordering so that it might be ordered along with all the rest? The answer is that _Being is not infinite_. A condition for the actualization of the next ordinal number that orders not only all things that exist but the order in which they exist is an infinity upon which to map that next ordinal. 

If there were no Death, Being would have the capacity to be complete with respect to the things that are possible, so that possibility would no longer be a thing with any meaning. That we die removes certain possibilities from the possibility of ever attaining actualization. 

the inability of human mathematics to capture the totality of numbers in finite symbols is a manifestation of this fundamental truth. 

TODO

## The Relation of Being

If Being itself can be said to be anything at all, then it must be a relationship. In other words, Being is a map between the component parts which exist _in_ a complex, i.e. the way in which things are _with_ one another. It follows by necessity that Being must obey the laws of relations[^Appendix#1]. Therefore, we next turn towards the analysis of Being insofar that it is a relation. 

A relation between two parts _x_ and _y_ can be written as a symbolic proposition,

`x R y`

We may substitue the relation of `run faster than` for R, `cheetahs` for _x_ and `turtles` for y to obtain a definite proposition from this symbolic form. As another example, we may also substitute relations like `nephew of` for R, `Augustus` for x and `Julius` for y. Indeed, all dyadic relations can be reduced to this symbolic form, if the appropriate substitutions are made. 

Relations have certain properties that define how they operate over the domain of indefinite variables supplied as arguments to them. The _theory of relations_ is the study of these properties when the relation between the parts is left indeterminate, just as the _x_ and _y_ are left as indeterminate variables. In other words, the formal inquiry into relations treats relations in the abstract sense, where the exact relation is not considered, but instead is given arbitrarily, so the arguments thus formed will apply to _all_ relations. Being is not exempt from this universality. It is for the reason of enhancing our understanding of Being that we study the properties of relations in this section,

Following **Tarski**, [^Tarski#2] [^Author#1]

> A relation _R_ is called **reflexive in set K** if every element _x_ of the set _K_ has the relation _R_ to itself

This can be expressed symbolically as,

`x R x` 

The relation of numerical equality `=` satisfies this definition, since it is the case `1 = 1`, `2 = 2`, etc. Another reflexive relation is seen in the relation of parallelity between lines, if the definition of _parallelity of lines_ is such that lines which have the same direction are considered parallel.

Examples of relations that do not satisfy this definition can be seen in the propositional functions  `x precedes y`, `x greater than y`, etc. If the arguments are reversed in these relations, they necessarily change the relation implied between its part, i.e. `x precedes y` is not the same as `y precedes x`, unless we identify the _x_ in the former proposition with the _y_ in the latter and visa versa.

Reflexivity is an essential condition for equivalence. A relation, whatever its form, cannot be used to express identity if it is not reflexive. 

## The Fundamental Problem of Aristotelian Physics


In attempting to define a thing as existence, we have passed by its Being entirely. For if the Being of a table was reducible to its existence, i.e. its chemical composition, then it should not occur that separate existents should be separate tables, that is to say, if Being were identical to existence, a steel table would be a wholly different Being from the tree stump offered to the midday travellers as their lunch table. It is, however, the case that a table can exist through different mediums and retain its "table-ness", so that in the account of only its physical properties, we do not touch upon at all what it is that defines a table. 

These ambiguities between Being and existnce no doubt result from double duty _is_ performs in our language. For when we say a _thing is_, we typically mean a _thing exists_, where as when we say a _thing is this_, we should understand this proposition as a proposition about its Being. 
  
TODO 

Matters are complicated with the introduction of time, for now a thing no longer simply _is_, but contains a multitude of ways of coming to be: _is_, _was_, _will be_, _has been_. With this terminology, it becomes clear Being intrinsically contains a dimension of time and space, so that Being is said to be with respect to time and with respect to space. 

TODO

The first philosophical analysis of Being of which we are aware comes down to us through the Greek tradition. **Aristotle**, in particular, living more than two thousand years ago, synthesized the works of all that preceded into a single train of though. Despite the age of his works, they have remained throughout history a source of considerable study, in particular his contributions to the so-called _primary_ philosophy, what would be called today _ontology_, the study of Being itself. The essence of his contributions to untangling of the puzzle of Being are chiefly found in _Physics_ and _Metaphysics_. 

The essential problem is this: A being is on one hand a substance, a material, matter. On the other hand, it is a multiplicity of _things_. A thing is at once a substance and a representative of something beyond the subtance. For instance, wood is a substance that assumes the form of a table or a chair. In either case, a different thing _becomes_ from the same underlying substance, yet the form of the substance differentiates the _things_ in their thinghood.

The substance signifies through its form its inclusion in a _category_ of Being. This wood _is_ a table; the substance _is_ a thing. But in this, there is, as **Aristotle** was wont to say a puzzle (_aporia_); for a substance can _be_ many things; the table _is_ brown; the table _is_ three feet high; the table _is_ where meals happen. In each of these _beings_, there is an element of _coincidence_, where the particular thing, the table, need not have these _attributes_. Because of this, there is a _category_ demarcating a space of attributes, of the complete enumeration of possibilities of a given substantial form, encompassing the _being_ of a table, in all its multivariate ways. Being is, in Aristotelian physics, the becoming of Form through Substance. 

In this division between Substance and Form, there is a trap that is perhaps impossible to avoid, for it perplexed a millenia of philsophers until the time of **Heidegger**. With the Aristotelian dyad of Substance and Form, we have the beginnings of the so-called mind-body dualism, which was properly synthesized as a framework by **Descartes**, that posits two modes of Being, mapping roughly one-to-one with substance and form, the _res extensa_ and the _res cogitans_, the Being of the physical and the Being of the mental. 

It is this system of thought that mathematizes the physical as pure extension and duration. All things are ordered pairs of attributes and the universe is determined via the changing relationships of its parts. In other words, the _res extensa_, the Being of substance, is a volume of space changing with respect to time. 

The _res cogitans_ is separate from this substance, in the way that we mean it _is_ _about_ the substance. In other words, the Being of the mental, because it _is not_ substance, is _insubstantial_. In this way, we cannot properly say a table _is_ a table at all, for a table is a mental construct on top of the physical Being of matter, so we must rather say, in a "scientific way", its physical counterpart is all that is, and all other designations are purely subjective. The thing which we call a table is in reality reduced to natural forces operating on the world-substance; it is a mathematical equilibrium, or atleast temporarily so. 

There is an element of truth in this interpretation. How could there not be? It is this insight into the nature of Being that led to great revolutions of mathematics and science seen in the eighteenth and nineteenth century. Yet, we must admit, with respect to our phenomenal experience, this description is somehow lacking. With this interpretation, the table is a table because the Being of the mental designates it so, not because it _is_ a table. If we recall a table need not be constructed by human hand to be a table, for a tree stump or any elevated surface would serve the function just as well, the puzzle becomes clearer. 

We here recall the immortal words of the Bard, "A rose by any other name would smell just as sweet." 

TODO

There is yet another way a thing is said to be and that is through the linguistic form of _am_. The notion of _am_ is no general one to be affixed to an indefinite object, for this Being symbolizes a different type of Being altogether: the first person singular present tense. If language is a set of tools by which we represent ideas, _am_ is an orthogonality to the representative dimensions defined by the other forms of _to be_, in that it is a form that by necessity requires a conscious subject, a prior not previously required in the semantics of Being.

Likening a proposition to a function, we draw a parallel to mathematics: a function only has meaning over a certain domain in which it makes sense for its operations to be applied; or, from the surjective direction, we may say a certain domain and its projection define the meaning of a function (as Fourier showed, by reducing all functions on a certain interval to infinite series of trigonometric functions, that in aggregate sum to the functions' range), so that if we say _the function which is defined by the mapping between the set of things which do not exist and the set of natural numbers_, in some way we have defined what is meant by the notion of zero through this mapping and we may, in some sense, say the meaning of zero is _contained_ in the mapping. 

TODO

Likewise, the linguistic notion of _am_ brings with it a certain domain and a certain projection, which clarify its meaning, for the _(x,y)_ in the propositional function _x am y_ cannot be arbitrarily assigned over the space of subject-nouns, over the set of existent things. _Am_ defines a precise and particular subject: _us_. Specifically, _I_. 

This can be seen in the syntactical error that arises in the proposition _the thing am this_; the meaning of _am_ is only understood through _I am this_.
