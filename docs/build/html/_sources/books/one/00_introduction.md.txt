# The Question

**Albert Camus** once stated there is but one philosophical question and that is suicide[^Camus#1]. In this, **Camus** skipped over much to arrive at his starting point. However, to his credit, he only meant it in the rhetorical sense, as way to examine the absurdity of living in a universe where you are fated from the very start to die at the end. Nevertheless, there is a definite proximity to primordial truth in his formulation of the so-called "_philosophical question_". 

This is what **Camus** got wrong: There is no choice to be made in the face of Death. _All_ life is suicide, in a sense; it is merely the method of dying we are allowed to pick, and only then up to a point, as the survivors of self-inflicted gunshot wounds will attest. When one chooses to die, all that is accomplished is akin to skipping ahead to the end of a book. Everyone implicitly knows time is a poison that slowly kills, for it is taught to us from the very second of birth; a new-born infant left to its devices would surely die and if its cries can be understood at all it is only as a gasping for life, a choking on Being, a dim awareness that it is a thing and it is in mortal danger; Death is not conceptualized intellectually in this moment, but is apprehended in the nearest glance we ever get at its true form, that of unbridled fear and uncontrollable passion, a void where no reason can prevail; only through the intervention of an Other thing, a Being outside ourselves, is the infant we were allowed to live; from this we learn, or are atleast given the raw material for the conception of, causality, that our Being as a thing is affected by the Being of Other things, and, this being the point, that this affectation arises as an alteration of the infant's trajectory towards Death: a thing which is Other to ourselves prevents us from dying in our very first moment as a separate entity. If, in what follows, we come to see the Other as life, then it is only insofar that our Deaths are held at bay with their cooperation. Life, in this formulation, is not a positive phenomenon, but a denial of a total Nothingness. I am because I am not dead, and I do not die, at least for the time being, because the Other is and will not let me.

Only in the sequel, once Death is no longer immediate, do we come to understand the nature of time, in the way leaves wilt on dead tree limbs, in the way organic material rots, in the way delicate things are liable to break. A Being cannot _be_ without the phantom of Death shadowing its every step, making its presence known obliquely. All of these things we must realize before we consider the philosophical problem of terminating our own lives. Only in the subsequent development of self, once reflective consciousness enters into the equation, and we realize we are of a genre with all those things that pass away from Being in an abstract sense, do we ask whether or not a life always imperilled is worth living.

The thesis of the present work can be summed up succinctly in the opening paragraphs, so that no one need read any further and may at once put these words to rest so as to never think on them again: Death is the bedrock at the bottom of Being; it precedes us in every way, before knowledge and language, before awareness of time and space, before the birth of our historical self. In order to be we must possess the ability to die, first and foremost. As such, we are condemned to die simply by Being. Whether we die in ignorance or with full awareness of our mortality matters not to Death, because Death is not something that _cares_. From this and because of this, all things proceed. 

Despite being the foundation of almost every human pathology, Death as a field of inquiry has received comparatively little analysis over the course of history, except in the medical sciences where it is treated clinically, to be catalogued and diagnosed along with all the other maladies and diseases and thus placed into a knowable relation with the rest of Being, or in the spiritual studies, where it is mythologized and understood only through metaphor, never as an experience that happens _to_ us.

There is a reason for this: Death as a subject is repellant to individual understanding. Its very definition presupposes the limit of the knower; That is to say, Death is inherently unknowable. Death can only be understood through the mechanisms of analogy and metaphor, via the circuituous and torturous route of empty symbolism, for when we turn our attention directly to the object of Death it reveals itself as something which is not to be found in our Being. 

We can be aware that we will eventually die, we can perceive Others passing from this world, we can even in unique circumstances perceive the manner of our own Death, but none of this gets us any closer to the experience of Death, none of this allows us to see what it is like to die. Our experience and awareness of experience will never be extended into Death itself. We never see Death for what it is, because it is Nothing, the absence of our Being. Death is the point where experience and awareness stops.

In this way, we mean Death exists beyond the limit of understanding, in a way that destroys that which it transcends. For our Being in the world is inextricably tied to knowledge and an understanding of the world so much so we may be tempted to posit Death as that which removes this possibility from our Being, and thus annihiliates our Being. In this way, as a result of the unknowability of Death, the ontological necessity between our Being and knowledge emerges, for if our Being and Death are inverses and if Death is by definition unknowable, then it must follow that our Being is that which is knowable. The provisional aim of this work is to show this unknowability metaphysically precedes and constrains Being, and that furthermore this constraint imposes upon Being an ontological character. Death, in the unknowability of its Nothingness, illuminates Being. 

Death then, while unapproachable, becomes a way to understand our own Being, for it shows us the domain of the problem, the problem being what it means _to be_ in a world that must by necessity contain our Death. Death is `a priori` to Being, baked into all ontologies, even if their formulations hitherto do not explicitly acknowledge it as such. _To be_ inherently contains the possibility of _not Being_ as a necessary and sufficient condition for coming to be. Because things end in our perception, in time and space, they are differentiated; if all things were never ending, all objects would be continuous with one another, instead of distinct and separate; things are only distinct insofar that they are _not_ identical, so that to be distinct, it must be possible a thing is not something else; so if we then ask, _what is it that our Being is not?_ There is only one answer. The `invariance` of Death is a fundamental constant of nature and thus provides a universal metric by which to unpack existence into representative form. 

It will be argued by philosophers that the author has adopted a humanist perspective and has not sufficiently divested himself of the pecularities of _human_ Being. Death, they will argue, is not an ontological prior, but posterior to the notion of Being, for it is dependent on the numerous attributes of a particular _Being_; chemistry and biology could be otherwise, they will argue, so that life need not by necessity imply Death; the laws of energy, whereby all things eventually dissipate into heat, they will argue, need not be the case; the motivating factor in every human endeavor, they will argue, can be abstracted away from experience, so as to be analyzed in "scientific" isolation. 

This argument will be addressed in great detail throughout the course of this work, but as an immediate reply to those who hold fast the proposition, _it is possible to imagine Being without Death_, the question must be posed: _and what would that look like?_ 

To ask questions about a subject that perpetually recedes from all attempts to know it necessarily entails the admission up front that no answers can ever be conceived, much less perceived. The inevitable end result will be to arrive where we started, back in the here and now, having gained Nothing, except perhaps an understanding of what it means to be futile, which will anyway evaporate when we die; If any proposition can lay claim to human nature, this is it. 

It would seem, then, it does not matter which direction we choose to go, since we will always return to our starting point, no better or worse for having made the circuit. For this reason, the author recommends no one should read what follows. Instead, the reader is advised that going outside is by far a better course of action.

With the warnings of futility thus dispensed, we will preface our discourse with a brief tour through the current state of our understanding of what it means _to be_. If Death, as a philosophical concept, can be said to be anything, then it seems likely it must be as a negation of Being, or at the very least a certain _type_ of Being, the type of Being we ourselves have. 

There is in this an almost natural proclivity to view Death as the opposite of life, the terminus of life or boundary of life. In the colloquial sense, there is obviously true enough, but we are here inquiring in the precise of meaning of Death, the place it occupies in the mechanics of Being. Whether or not the subject of Death's negation is life, or a living thing, cannot yet be concluded, for it is not clear at this stage in what ways not Being dead is equivalent to Being alive, for a rock is said to not be dead, yet we do not conclude from that it is alive. Indeed, upon consideration, the exact definition of life is hard to pin down, for "_what is common among the living is life, but life in itself has no properties, attributes or characteristics. Thus, what is held in common among the living is itself nothing in particular_"[^Thacker#1] We therefore take it as a provisional hypothesis that Death is a negation of a _type_ of Being, not necessarily identical with _life_, with the understanding that we have much to show before this statement can be taken as fact and in what way it is to be understood. We have not yet defined what it, the Being to which we refer in the preceding as subject to Death, _is_ exactly, so that its negation likewise lacks clarity. 

Therefore, we first examine our understanding of Being in general to bring the scope of the problem into view. This will necessarily entail a discussion on the history of philosophy, language and logic, all in reference to how these fields have informed our understanding of Being. What is presented in this first book is by no means an exhaustive commentary, nor should it be taken as a coherent, chronological narrative; what follows is only meant to highlight pertinent concepts as they relate to the current analysis.

The maturity of a field of inquirty can be seen in how close to its foundations its crises occur. Mathematics, by far the most mature of the sciences, took more than two thousand years to move past the crises in its theorems, e.g. the determination of areas, the calculation of ratios, the solution of equations, etc., before finally grappling with the crises in its foundations, e.g. notions of primitives, of numbers, of infinity, of completeness and consistency (<sup><sub>and their inherent mutual exclusion</sub></sup>), etc. This direction of progress bears an interesting feature, in that it is the opposite of what we would expect if the intellect were purely rational. In logic you start with assumptions and apply rules of inference until arriving at the complex conclusion; this is the exact opposite of the actual history of mathematics. Humanity first needed to study the application of mathematics, via the straight edge and compass, via computation and ratio, before grappling with the meaning of its precepts, as if the foundation of mathematics was consequent upon its use. While counter-intuitive, further reflection reveals this is as it should be, for to know a thing deeply you must first know it approximately. There are no marriages built in darkness.

In the last four hundred years, a similar reckoning has been underway in philsophy. As a species, for the past two millenia, we have spent considerable time pondering the ephemeral consequences of morals and aesthetics, taking their existence as givens and working out the results of their application. With the formulation of **Cartesian** scepticism, the artifacts of **Aristotelian** philosophy were shattered in order to examine their constituent pieces and then reworked into grander schemes. A clear line of philosophers extending through **Descartes**, **Kant**, **Schopenhauer** and **Heidegger** began to challenge the notions upon which philosophy itself was built, by applying the analytical methods of rationalism to the most immediate of all datum: experience itself. We thus come to a crisis of philosophy in which even the most elementary questions one would think answerable provoke silence: What _are_ we? What _am_ I? What _is_ this? What _is_, in general? 

All of these questions derive from a more fundamental question: What does it mean _to be_?

There is an inherent problem with the application of the scientific method to the problem of Being, which these thinkers (and innumerable others no less worthy of mention) grappled with at great length, in that a investigation into Being will necessarily come to the point in which it must investigate, as a Being, that which is investigating, i.e. itself. Having placed the faculty of judgement that allows us to draw conclusions about the world _in the world_, we lack the outside perspective to judge the validity of such judgement and are left with only the proposition itself as a ballast, that is to say, the truth of our judgements about Being depend on whether those judgements contain within themselves their own truth, since that truth cannot be ascertained by reference to an external Being when the judgement is about the Being which judges.

By objectifying our Being and making it the focus of study, we necessarily lose its personal subjectivity, and render it unapproachable, passing by each other like two ships in the night. When one attempts to study that which studies, one must careful with the avenues of inquiry one selects to make clear and apparent the object of study, which in this case is no object at all, but the subject itself insofar that it is pure subjectivity.

When philosophy attempts to hew to the scientific method and objectifies the subject, it necessarily becomes formalism. For this reason, the project of philosophy in the modern world, instead of elucidating and clarifying the meaning of these terms with respect to the advances of modern science, by attempting to emulate the results of science outside the domain of its problemset, has become to explain away, not only consciousness, but Being itself, by reducing everything to representation and formulae, as if these representations and formulae did not exist as representation and formulae through our Being first and always before their subsequent interpretation as meaningful significations.

If philosophy is to remain in the modern world a field of inquiry independent of science, science being a field concerned with truth (or at the very least the removal of falsity), then philosophers must seek refuge in meaning, for meaning is the last stronghold not yet stormed by science and for good reason; Science, for all its exactness, cannot touch our Being. No description is capable of anything beyond indicating what is the case; _what is the case_, however, is not an indication, but the actual events that make up the world. Every description is a description _of_ the world _in_ the world; the only way a word could have true Being is if it stood for its own letters, instead of meaning something beyond its letters, something that can only be encountered by a Being that deals in meaning. It is the one and only task of philosophy to explain the way in which this transcedence occurs, and what it is that is happening when this happens. 

Philosophy cannot be disavowed of this task even if that happening happens to be Nothing. Indeed, if what we are turns out to be Nothing at all, then there is no more urgent task to consider than that of philosophy. What other tool [ready-to-hand](HEIDEGGER_TODO) would stand chance against Nothing? In the annihiliating nightmare of nihilism, we all necessarily become philosophers.
