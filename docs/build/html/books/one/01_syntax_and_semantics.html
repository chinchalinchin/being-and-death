<h1>The Syntactic Structure and Semantic Meaning of Being<a class="headerlink" href="#the-syntactic-structure-and-semantic-meaning-of-being" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The project of philosophy is to make clear what we are, to present for the understanding the concepts which underlie our Being, the Being that occurs when some small pocket of the world turns on the rest and declares itself separate by the proclamation, <em>I am</em>. Philosophy should, in its rightful endeavor, provide the basis for understanding how this situation, that of the <em>am</em>, comes to be separate from the other types of Being, if that indeed is what is occuring. In essence, philosophy, if it is not to go the way of alchemy or phrenology, must answer the question: <em>what am I</em>?. Furthermore, it must does so in a way that distinguishes itself from the fields of pure logic, mathematics or physics. Whether or not philsophy is up to the task is the question currently at hand.</p>
<p>When asking <em>what am I?</em>, we necessarily bring with us an expectation the answer will assume the form <em>I am x</em>, or some essential variatian thereof, so that in order to answer this question we must first understand what type(s) of operands may be substituted for <em>x</em>  in the above and remain intelligible. We must also stash in the back of our thoughts the creeping notion that it may be the case there is no expression, within the structured forms of linguistic representation, that is capable of answering this question. We shall grant an answer is possible for the moment in order to see where it might lead, in which case, if there is to be an answer to the question <em>what am I?</em>, it must necessarily be of the form <em>I am x</em>, for the <em>what</em> in the question seeks a solution of the form <em>x</em>, of a <em>thing</em> to be determined.</p>
<p>The type of proposition represented by <em>I am x</em> is a particular case of a more general symbolic proposition, one that can be uncovered by recognizing <em>am</em> is a derivative of the same root as <em>is</em> (more on this tacit assumption to follow shortly), so that <em>I am x</em>, which might be rephrased more verbosely as <em>that which is me is x</em>, is really governed, at least in the limit, by the same algebra that governs simpler primitive terms captured symbollically by  <em>this is x</em>. We thus must preface our answer to <em>what am I?</em> with an answer to <em>what is this?</em>.</p>
<p>Before doing so we clarify a few things.</p>
<section id="relativizers-and-the-relative-that">
<h2>Relativizers and the Relative That<a class="headerlink" href="#relativizers-and-the-relative-that" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The use of <em>that</em> in the preceding <em>that which is me</em> is to be understood as a linguistic <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativizer">relativizer</a>, and not the indicative <em>that</em> which opposes the <em>this</em>. It is the <em>that</em> identified in the construction <em>this is something that is useful</em> as opposed to the <em>that</em> identified in the construction <em>that is something</em>. In the latter case, the <em>that</em> is a quantification, a particular case, a <em>thing</em>. In the former case, the <em>that</em> is no <em>thing</em>, but a way of nesting a relation of Being contained in the secondary predicate, <em>is useful</em>, so that its content flows back to the subject whose Being was previously indicated, the <em>this</em> which is <em>something</em>.</p>
<p>The role played by <em>that</em> in a <em>relativizer</em> has the same structure as the <em>that</em> used in that indicative sense, in that it encapsulates its operand into a single unit and binds together its multiplicites so as to ready it for substitution into the conjunctive form. But whereas the indicative <em>that</em> gathers the subject for the operation of the predicate, the relative <em>that</em> reflects back its predicate onto the subject of its attached proposition.</p>
<p>The construction <em>this is something that is useful</em> is logically equivalent to the conjunction of the separate propositions <em>this is something</em> and <em>something is useful</em>. There is, however, a subtle difference in meaning. The conjunction of propositions implies its components are atomic, that is to say, both <em>this is something</em> and <em>something is useful</em> are separate propositions that attain a new meaning when conjoined, whereas the relativized statement unit the distinct parts into a continuous whole, so that is properties may not be separated.</p>
<p>The <em>relativizer</em> and the relative <em>that</em> are useful devices, but whether or not they are necessary grammatical forms is not so apparent. <em>Here is something that is useful</em> may be replaced in almost all cases to the similar form <em>here is something useful</em>. Colloquially, the phraseologies are near enough equivalent that they may be treated the same, but the question remains on the philosophical level if the difference is an artifact of linguistic ambiguity and inconsistency or if a <em>relativizer</em> deserves a special place in the grammar of Being.</p>
<p>The <em>relativizer</em> exists in the oldest languages of which we still have historical documentation. It plays a central role, for instance, in the name early humans gave to God. In the opening books of the Torah, within the text of <strong>Exodus</strong>, God reveals his true name to Moses on Mount Sinai<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#torah-1" id="id1">1</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>And Moses said unto God: ‘Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them: The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me: What is His name? what shall I say unto them?’</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>And God said unto Moses: ‘I AM THAT I AM’; and He said: ‘Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel: I AM hath sent me unto you.’</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>God’s reply to Moses, derived from Hebrew,</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>אֶהְיֶה (ehyé) אֲשֶׁר (’ăšer) אֶהְיֶה (ehyé)</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>has been translated numerous ways: <em>I am that I am</em>, <em>I am what I am</em>, <em>I am what am</em>, <em>I am that am</em>, <em>I am who am</em>.</p>
<p>The Hebrew word, אֶהְיֶה, is the first person singular of the infinitive הָיָה, pronounced phonetically as “hâyâh”, which translates as <em>to be, become, come to pass, exist, happen, fall out</em><a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#strong-1" id="id2">2</a>. Modern Hebrew conjugates God’s reply in the future tense, i.e. <em>I will be what I will be</em>. However Hebrew at the time did not differentiate tenses. There was no difference, atleast grammatically speaking, in Ancient Hebrew between the notions of <em>will be</em>, <em>has been</em> and <em>is now</em>.</p>
<p>The term, אֲשֶׁר, is the semantic device known as a <em>relativizer</em> just discussed. Quite literally, the Hebrew Torah states, God is the <em>am that am</em>, where <em>that</em> is understood as a nesting operation, where the Being on the right hand side of the <em>relativizer</em> is ascribed to the Being on the left hand side in addition to its own Being.</p>
<p>The name Judaism gave to God, <em>Yahweh</em>, understood through the so-called <span class="xref myst">tetragrammaton</span>, in one intrepretation could be seen as an attempt by early humans to distinguish what they are from what is, that is to say, as a way to differentiate the <em>am</em> from the <em>is</em>. The choice of first person singular, as opposed to the impersonal third person, is telling in this respect, for it is a claim about the Being of God, namely that God is in the same way the subject of <em>I am</em> is.</p>
<p>Our first inclination to the divine, as it has come down to us, was an expression of what is meant by our Being, identifying it as equivalent to the Being of the divine. <em>Yahweh</em> is to be understood, in this interpretation, as an assertion that <em>am</em> is distinct from <em>is</em>, that what we are is more than what is given to us.</p>
<p>According to our ancestors’ account, God is what <em>I am</em>. God is the <strong>Cartesian</strong> <em>sum</em>. Interpretted in the literal sense, this account of the divine identifies our type of Being, the Being that is contained in (or revealed by) the I’s <em>am</em>, as a a separate sort of Being from that of other Beings, and this separateness is exactly what gives rises to the classification of the divine.</p>
<p><strong>Descartes</strong> himself employs the <em>relativizer</em> in his famous <em>Discourse</em> when he attempts to answer the question _what am <em>I</em>. As expected, his answer is of the form <em>I am x</em>, but with the aid of a <em>relativizer</em>, he is able to add a layer of complexity to the answer, essentially hiding details in the indeterminate form of <em>x</em> with the appropriate use of a relative <em>that</em>. <em>I am a thing that has thoughts</em>, he replies, “<em>I was a substance the whole essence or nature <strong>of which</strong> is to think</em>”<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#descartes-1" id="id3">3</a></p>
<p>For the final confirmation of the validity of the relative <em>that</em> as an ontological relation, we turn to mathematics. In the primitive symbols of set theory, the function of the <em>relativizer</em> can be seen in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">|</span></code> that designates the variables over which a proposition is quantified. For example, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">axiom</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">abstraction</span></code> given in the following symbolic proposition,<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#appendix-1" id="id4">4</a></p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">#y</span> <span class="pre">|</span> <span class="pre">[</span> <span class="pre">&#64;x</span> <span class="pre">|</span> <span class="pre">x</span> <span class="pre">~</span> <span class="pre">y</span> <span class="pre">&amp;</span> <span class="pre">P(x)</span> <span class="pre">]</span></code></p>
<p>can be translated into English as <em>there exists a y <strong>such that</strong> for all x <strong>such that</strong> if and only if x belongs to y, then x has the property P</em>. The obtuse translation is meant to draw the attention to the analogous role of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">|</span></code> and the relative <em>that</em>.</p>
<p>It would seem in trying to answer what we are, a single relation of Being is insufficient and <em>that</em> such answers require grammatical tools <em>that</em> allow for Being to flow recursively through a sentence. We thus revise our expectation of the answer to <em>what am I</em> from _ I am x_ to the form <em>I am x that y</em>, where <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> are indeterminate variables.</p>

<section id="being-as-a-linguistic-invariant">
<h2>Being as a Linguistic Invariant<a class="headerlink" href="#being-as-a-linguistic-invariant" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>With the discussion of the <em>relativizer</em> in mind and its unique role played in certain historical answers to the question <em>what am I</em>, there is another point to address, one that cannot be skipped over before proceeding. We have, in the previous paragraphs made the assumption the Being of the <em>am</em> is a cousin to the Being of the <em>is</em>. We must now turn to an argument raised by <strong>Alfred Tarski</strong>, in which we must consider <em>“that the semantical concepts have a relative character, that they must always be related to a particular language.”</em><a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#tarski-1" id="id5">5</a></p>
<p>It might be the case the conjugation of <em>to be</em> into its derivative forms, <em>is</em> and <em>am</em>, is a conceptual union not born out in the facts. When we talk about the Being of <em>am</em> and compare it to the Being of <em>is</em>, are we being misled by the language used to express these ideas into supposing a coincidence of meaning where in fact there is none?</p>
<p>This is, in questions involving Being, the central question: whether <em>what I am</em> is of a genre with <em>what this is</em>, and moreover whether this mutual origin is linguistic or ontological. If we are to establish any sort of ontological relation between the meaning of these two terms independent of the knowledge granted by language, we must be careful in understanding <strong>Tarski</strong>’s argument.</p>
<p>In one reading, we might think <strong>Tarski</strong> is saying meaning, i.e. semantical conceptualization, is ephemeral, a property of a system, without use outside of that system. While not entirely inaccurate, the exact meaning is subtler by far, for his argument relies on the notion of <em>relative</em>.</p>
<p>Things are only said to be <em>relative</em> insofar as there is an invariant quantity available to all frames of reference that allows the calculation of by how much the relative quantities in the system have changed. In <strong>Galilean</strong> relativity, the invariant quantity is space and time, so that all motion is relative to immovable space-time; since all frames of reference measure the same lengths and times, motion is able to be viewed relative to either reference without loss of fidelity. In <strong>Einsteinian</strong> relativity, the invariant is the speed of light, so that space and time themselves are relative to this fixed quantity, and frames of reference will adjust their spatial and temporal metrics accordingly to accomodate this constant.</p>
<p>If meaning is determined by the language from which it arose, what is the ultimate invariant quantity to which language itself must conform in order to prescribe a metric for meaning? With careful thought, the answer is obvious. If there is one constant to be found in all the various languages in the world, at any given time in the spoken history of humanity, it is found in the words: _Be, <em>Ser</em>, <em>Sein</em>, <em>Shi</em>, <em>Desu</em>, etc. The invariant of language is, of course, Being itself. In the same way the speed of light requires space and time to become the quantities necessary for its correct calculation, Being requires language to become forms which can represent it.</p>
<p>We are thus asking if the conjugation of <em>am</em> deserves recognition as an ontological operation over and above the existential operation of <em>is</em> which structures language, or if it is a redundancy that is already included in <em>is</em> or merely a semantical construct with no meaning outside of language. If the first case obtains, <em>am</em> provides structure distinct from the structure of the <em>is</em>, essentially performing the function of dimensionalizing laneguage, and the question <em>what am I</em> has been granted a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for a meaningful answer. If either of thee latter cases obtain, then the answer we seek is clearly some variation of <em>I am Nothing</em>.</p>
<p>Insight into this question can be gained by studying the historical origins of Being in our language. Language is an archeological treasure hiding in plain sight, a living autobiography of history. <strong>Ludwig Wittgenstein</strong> likened language to “<em>an ancienty city: a maze of little streets and squares, of old and new houses, and of houses with additions from various periods; and this surrounded by a multitude of new boroughs with straight regular streets and uniform houses</em>”[^Wittgenstein#1] In other words, language is not an absolute, but a process, constantly shifting forms and revealing new realms of meaning, but retaining its essential function: that of representation and signification.</p>
<p>In modern English, <em>Being</em> is the marriage of two concepts that were previously distinct. Its etymology descends from the coupling of the Old English words <em>beon</em> and <em>wesan</em>, which can be in turn, if the theorists are to be believed, traced further back to the Proto-Indo-European roots of <em>bheu</em> and <em>wes</em>, respectively. For this reason, we conjugate from the infinitive <em>to be</em> <em>B</em>-root words <em>be</em>, <em>been</em> and <em>being</em> and <em>W</em>-root words <em>was</em> and <em>were</em>. <em>Is</em>, a direct cognate from Old English, is the present tense conjugation of <em>wesan</em>, revealing its hereditary from the <em>es</em>-stem roots that form the concept of Being in other Proto-Indo-European languages, such as the Spanish <em>estar</em> or TODO.</p>
<p>It is in the meaning of these words prior to their symbosis we shall find a starting point for understanding the separation of <em>am</em> and <em>is</em>. The differences between the semantic function of <em>beon</em> and <em>wesan</em> is slight, but potent.</p>
<p><em>Wesan</em> is the Being of objects and nouns. It is the <em>is</em> of the <em>this</em> and <em>that</em>, the <em>the</em> and the <em>a</em>. When affixed to a name, <em>wesan</em> indicates existence, what is actual about its subject. <em>He is here</em>, <em>you will be tired</em>, <em>there are three of them</em>. These are all existential statements of particular cases, facts which can be determined true or false by reference to reality. This type of concrete Being is contained in <em>wesan</em>. TODO EXAMPLE TODO</p>
<p>To put it succinctly, <em>wesan</em> is the empirical <em>is</em>, the <em>is</em> which refers to the external world. <em>Beon</em>, however, is the Being of the abstraction and adjectives. <em>Beon</em> indicates an object’s <span class="xref myst">gnomic aspect</span>. In the parlance of logic, a <em>gnomic</em> truth is a universal assertion, a statement of generality that applies to all things of which it speaks. While the Being of modern English does not have a direct <em>gnomic</em> form, a <em>gnomic</em> proposition can be induced by the removal of the particularizing article <em>the</em> in the following: <em>the birds are fast</em>. The use of <em>the</em> in this sentence refers to a particular group of birds, whereas the proposition <em>birds are fast</em> does not refer to any definite bird, but references the <em>gnomic aspect</em> of birds, i.e. the abstraction of form common to all avian entities.  It is in this context that <em>beon</em> is conjugated in Old English. TODO EXAMPLE TODO</p>
<p>Mandarin has a similar variation in how it unpacks the relations of Being into representative form. In Mandarin, the verb (literal mandarin) <em>shi</em> can only be affixed to nouns, to signs representing physical objects. (literal mandarin) <em>Ni shi zhongguo ren</em>; you are Chinese. However, (literal mandarin) <em>shi</em> cannot be affixed to adjectives, such as beautiful. For that, the extra verb (literal mandarin) <em>hen</em> is required.</p>
<p>We have here  again in <em>shi</em> and <em>hen</em> the distinction of meaning found in <em>wesan</em> and <em>beon</em>, that of actuality versus abstraction. Indeed, this is a common duality to be found in languages across the world.</p>
<p>When <em>beon</em> and <em>wesan</em> were gradually merged in modern English, two meanings came to inhabit the same word. Still, to this day, it could be argued, these meanings have not yet been fully integrated. There are defects in the merger that can be glimpsed, when words falter slightly in their aspect and <em>Being</em> reveals its separate meanings. The English <em>Being</em> haphazardly applies the ideas of concrete and abstract reality simultaneously, thereby allowing assertions of existence to be mixed with assertions of conceptualization, as seen in the propositions <em>there is love</em>, <em>this is justice</em>, <em>we are eternal</em>. The English <em>is</em> is capable of abstracted existence, existence that is not reducible to objective reality.</p>
</section>
<section id="logical-consistency">
<h2>Logical Consistency<a class="headerlink" href="#logical-consistency" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It in this muddle of semantics that we are seeking to extract an answer to the question <em>what am I</em>. It is at this point we must ask what it is we require of an answer so that we might recognize it as such.</p>
<p>A novice logician might reply <em>consistency</em>, by which is meant the idea that language is really an axiomatic system from which propositions are constructed according to syntactical rules, so that we start with primitives notions like <em>set</em>, <em>element</em> and <em>belong</em>, then we formalize the semantics of these concepts with quantified propositions such as <em>there exists a set</em> and <em>some things have the property of belonging to that set</em>, then we proceed to define more complex notions such as equivalence through the formalized semantics these primitive notions afford, used in conjunction with the laws of logic (modus ponens, syllogism, etc.), e.g.. <em>if belonging to a first set implies belonging to a second set and if belonging to the second set implies belonging to the first set, then both sets are said to the be equivalent</em>.</p>
<p><em>Consistency</em> is the idea that all such statements thus constructued, if proceeding from a correct set of axioms (possibly infinite in number), will always yield a determinate statement. By determinate, it is meant, given the truth of the axioms, the truth of the statement can be judged purely as a function of syntax. Or put another way, all statements in the system can be reduced to statements about the primitive notions that compose the foundation of the system. In mathematics, all theorems ultimately become theorems about sets, elements and the concept of <em>belonging</em>, when the appropriate substitutions are made for the <span class="xref myst">definien</span> in the complex definitions that are built up through the application of syntax (a mathematical function f(x), for instance, can be defined as a mapping of sets to one another). All meaning in the system is built up through the meaning given to the primitive notions, i.e. what a <em>set</em> is, what an <em>element</em> is and what it means for an <em>element</em> to <em>belong</em> to a <em>set</em>. The semantics of the system are entirely incapable of saying what it is these primitive notions actually are, for all meaning in the language system comes from what it is they mean, i.e. the concept <em>equivalence</em> is reducible to the concept of <em>belonging</em>, but the concept of <em>belonging</em> has no further definition; it is what is simply what is meant by the symbol <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">~</span></code> in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">#A</span> <span class="pre">|</span> <span class="pre">&#64;x</span> <span class="pre">|</span> <span class="pre">x</span> <span class="pre">~</span> <span class="pre">A</span> <span class="pre">v</span> <span class="pre">A</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">0</span></code>^[Appendix#1]. In other words, the meaning of the primitive notions must be given in the intuition before the syntactical consequences of their meaning is dispersed through the structure of the system. Once the primitive meanings are given, the content of that meaning must necessarily follow the rules of syntax.</p>
<p>Moreover, <em>consistency</em> requires that any statements which are thus formed should <em>not</em> be capable of contradicting any other proposition formed by the same rules of syntax. Given a set of axioms, it should not be the case, for example, the propositions <em>there is an x that is A</em> and <em>there is an x that is not A</em> should mutually exclude the other’s possibility.</p>
<p>TODO</p>
<p>Here is as good as place as any to give pause to understanding the difference between syntax and semantics. Consider the arguments:</p>
<p><em>All mammals are warm-blooded, all whales are mammals, therefore all whales are warmblooded</em>.</p>
<p><em>If the ball is dropped, then it falls is equivalent to the ball is falling or it has not been dropped</em><br />
These lines of reasoning are syntactical, because they are valid if their content is abstracted away from them, as seen in the following,</p>
<p><em>All x are y, all z are x, therefore all z are y.</em>
<em>if x then y is equivalent to x or not y.</em></p>
<p>Strictly speaking, we should only speak of truth when the operation of assertion is involved, so we do not say these propositions are true, for that is the purview of the terms which have been abstracted away from them, but rather these propositions provide the syntax for their asserted content to become true.</p>
<p>TODO</p>
<p>A question that is not often addressed in the literature is whether or not an inconsistent system can still be meaningful.</p>
<p>If a system is complete, then it is inconsistent. But does the inverse hold? If we start from an inconsistent language, does that imply the lacunae of possible meaning in that language is complete?</p>

<section id="existential-versus-abstract-being">
<h2>Existential versus Abstract Being<a class="headerlink" href="#existential-versus-abstract-being" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>TODO</p>
<p>The question of the <em>am</em> is then intricately related to the question of language, and in what way the meaning of the <em>am</em> carries with it the invarance of the <em>is</em> (semantically speaking); that is, in what way the meaning implied by <em>am</em> in language is necessary for language to be language?</p>
<p>TODO</p>
<p>Separating out the components of the answer to the question <em>what is this?</em>, we have in <em>this is x</em> three terms: <em>this</em>, <em>is</em>, and <em>x</em>. The sentence must find its meaning in the meaning of its components. <em>This</em> and <em>x</em> are perhaps the easiest to understand, for they are <em>existential</em> terms.</p>
<p><em>This</em> carries with it a unary operation, in that anything thus denoted <em>this</em> becomes a single unit, regardless of its structure. When we say <em>this is a calculator</em>, we have amalgamated not only the abstractions of buttons, internal circuitry and plastic casing into a single gestalt, into a single concept, but moreover, we have synthesized the representative forms of color, solidity, extension, etc, into a common form across our senses. <em>This</em> represents the coincidence of forms into conceptual novelty.</p>
<p>If <em>this</em> is monadic in its application, then <em>x</em> is variadic. Where as the <em>this</em> collasces the different parts participating in the same underlying form, the <em>x</em> disperses the possibility of forms across an infinite range of things. There are many answers to <em>what is this?</em> and in each case the role by the <em>x</em>, regardless of its form, remains the same.</p>
<p>TODO</p>
<p>When we say <em>a thing is</em> and <em>a thing is this</em>, we have in mind two different ideas, due to the divergent of Being in English. There is in these two possible applications of <em>is</em> the notions of existence and abstraction, respectively.</p>
<p>In the former case, the proposition is a claim of existence in general, regardless of its particulars; the proposition <em>a thing is</em> could be restated in equivalent form as <em>a thing exists</em>. To achieve the broadest generality and thus bring the full range of meaning into view, we make the subject of the sentence indefinite and say <em>something is</em>.</p>
<p>Allowing the subject of this simple proposition to take on any value, we have arrived at the most elementary proposition that can be expressed in any philosophical framework. It is self-evident, however distorted our perception of the world may be and however uncertain we are of all that we experience, that we can at the very least say, <em>something is</em>. What it is this something is, while possibly beyond our ability to comprehend, cannot be Nothing for the simple fact that it <em>is</em>. If the world is nothing but illusion, then it <em>is</em> still illusion.</p>
<p>The <strong>Cartesian</strong> <em>sum</em> is really a particular form of the essential truth <em>something is</em>, where the primary state of Being from which all others proceed is assumed to be that of consciousness. The fallacy in this ontological proof <em>cogito ergo sum</em> is the <em>cogito</em> is not primitive; there are truths that precede it in form, namely, the latin <em>est</em>, the something which is.</p>
<p>The existence of <em>something</em>, of the general thing, is more certain than the I’s <em>am</em>, because in order to be an <em>I</em>, <em>I</em> must first be separate from <em>something</em>, <em>I</em> must be differentiated in type and form from the general thing. Therefore, the <em>something is</em> precedes the <em>I am</em>. From the thing’s general form, the arbitrariness contained in the <em>some</em>, we see the <em>thing</em> which <em>I am not</em> that precedes <em>me</em> need not be a particular thing, it need not have any properties except Being distinct from <em>me</em>. For this reason, the thing which is prior to <em>I</em> is not necessarily determined in its form; It is only existence, in indeterminate form, that precedes <em>my</em> Being.</p>
<p>We do not require in this formulation, at this point, that a <em>thing</em>’s appearance correspond to its existence, for whether or not things are as they appear is irrelevant with respect to their differentation from <em>my</em> Being. If what I perceive is not what actually is, then it is only because <em>something is</em> that I cannot perceive. Existence must be presupposed before that of consciousness.</p>
<p><em>I</em> can not be mistaken for <em>this thing</em>, because what <em>I am</em> is not what <em>that is</em>.</p>
<p>TODO</p>
<p>The proposition <em>a thing is</em> says nothing about the ways in which the thing exists, only that it is so, whereas the proposition <em>a thing is this</em> seems to belong to the former case in that it declares not only is it so, but further, it is so in such-and-such a way, so we are easily led to the conclusion the latter is a more particular case of the former.</p>
<p>TODO</p>
<p>Before drawing that conclusion, let us examine the negation of each, for the relation of the negated parts makes clearer the relation obtaining between the original parts.</p>
<p>When we say <em>a thing is not</em>, we mean that it does not exist. With this claim, a <em>thing</em>’s potential to be a <em>thing</em> has been removed, except removed absolutely in the sense that it can never be in the first place. We must be careful in the interpretation of this proposition, for we bump against the process of Being when we vaguely apply the rules of conjugation and propose: <em>this does not exist yet, but it may come to be</em> or <em>this did exist, but now no longer does</em>. For we have invited the notion of Being in through the backdoors of <em>does</em> and <em>did</em>, when what we wanted was to examine the notion of negated existence in isolation. We therefore clarify that by existence we do not mean with respect to time and space, but absolutely in itself.</p>
<p>As an example, we could say <em>God is not</em>, <em>unconditional love is not</em> or <em>a color without an electromagnetic frequency is not</em>. When we say <em>God is not</em>, we are careful not to include, even in thought, the addition of <em>here</em>, i.e. <em>God is not here</em>, for that would undo the whole meaning, implying that God might instead be over <em>there</em>. <em>God is not</em> is an absolute denial of existence, a removal of possibility from the world entire.</p>
<p>The negation of <em>a thing is this</em> does not undo the <em>thingness</em> of the subject, but rather the source of its <em>thingness</em>. In the negation of this proposition, the existence of the underlying subject <em>thing</em> is not negated; indeed, it is affirmed as an instance of something but not of <em>this</em>. <em>A thing is not this</em> does not mean the thing does not exist, but rather that it exists, but is not given by the thing we mean by <em>this</em>; we may therefore say <em>a thing is that</em>. It is therefore the case the proposition <em>a thing is not</em> is not contained in the proposition <em>a thing is not this</em>, for a thing which is not this is still a thing.</p>
<p>As an example, we could say <em>God is not this</em> and we do not thereby deny his existence, only his particular form. If God is not this, then he must be <em>that</em>. Being is a division of existence into what is <em>this</em> versus what is <em>that</em>.</p>
<p>In other words, <em>a thing is this</em> and its negation <em>a thing is not this</em> both assume the existence of the underlying thing. The negation of one does not nullify the existence of its subject, so that whatever is meant by <em>a thing is</em> belongs to both <em>a thing is this</em> and <em>a thing is not this</em>. Nowhere to be found in either proposition are the effects of <em>a thing is not</em>.</p>
<p>This may be seen in another way. If the relation between Being and existence is one of containment, then it is either the case they are identical, a thing exists without being or a thing can be without existing. The first case, that of identity, can be ruled out, for the aforementioned reasons. Therefore, if a hierarchy relates existence to Being, then it is either the case Being contains existence, or existence contains Being.</p>
<p>In one way, when we say a <em>thing exists</em> we mean that a <em>thing</em> can be located at particular place, at a particular time. It exists by virtue of its encounterability in the world. In this formulation, existence is an <em>instantiation</em> of a category of <em>thingness</em>, a projection from possibility-space to real-space. But what is it that <em>the thing</em> acquires in crossing the boundary between the possible and the real? One is tempted to postulate matter, the stuff of material, as what separates existence from possibility, but before including this postulate in our canon, we continue the clarification of the term <em>existence</em>.</p>
<p>In another way, we say things, such as triangles, exist. But in this sense, existence has a transitive property, for the existence of triangles is necessitated by the existence of more primitive terms, namely lines and angles and these from more primitive terms still, such as extension and curvature, and the operations thereof used to combine them. The existence of triangles is dependent on the existence of the axioms used to construct its concept, so that when we claim the existence of a triangle, ultimately our claim is reduced to the existence of it constituents.</p>
<p>In truth, these two aspects of existence lead back to each other. When the aforementioned transitive property of existence is applied to the natural world and we claim a <em>thing</em> exists, the proposition, as properly understood, is a claim about the actual components of the <em>thing</em>, that is, there is an existent underlying the thing. In seeking to find the primary <em>thing</em>, the <em>thing</em> upon which all other existences are based, we are led down a series of divisions, segrating the <em>thing</em> into its components, until its components become nothing but pure existence. At some point, the end of this series leads to particles, to quanta of attributes (i.e. mass, charge, spin, position, velocity, etc.), these attributes being the “stuff” of existence.</p>
<p>There is yet another way we talk of existence that is not reducible to the previous two definitions. We say things like <em>the number one exists</em> and mean something else entirely different from the preceding. The argument that numbers are property of things, that is to say, that a number is always applied to a particular instancing of existents, i.e. three oranges, a dozen jurors, a million citizens, is fallacious in the following way. If number were an attribute of things, or atleast their aggregation, then number could not exceed the totality of existent things, or atleast the totality of possible things. If the number of (possible) things is finite, the absurdity is shown by adding one to their sum. If the number of things is infinite, the absurdity is shown by asking in how many ways the things which exist can be ordered, that is to say, we have here a number not included in the supposed infinity of things, of which number is supposedly an attribute.</p>
<p>This contradiction shows either the existence of number is independent of the thing whose existence it quantifies, for how else can a collection of things be ordered except by a number which exceeds their quantity, or that existence contains a dimension of numerability not reducible to quantity. If the latter were the case, universal statements, such as <em>all whales are mammals</em> would not possible, for it would not be enough to identify a thing as a whale to conclude it is a mammal, but the order in which it appears in the totality of whales would emerge as an additional condition which must be ascertained before the truth of the proposition could be judged. That this is not the case, i.e. knowing <em>all whales are mammals</em> is sufficient to determine whether this particular whale is a mammal, leads us to conclude number is separate from the physical matter it quantifies.</p>
<p>The existence of number is always thus, separable and distinct from the existence of things which are enumerated. In this way, existence can be said to be beyond the things, i.e. the substance or matter, to which it also applies. We have here our first ballast by which to divide Being from existence: in the realm of Number, there always exists a thing which can not be, by virtue of ordering. In mathematics, these numbers are known as ordinal numbers.</p>
<p>TODO</p>
<p>What is it in our Being that prevents the complete quantification of all numbers? Why is it that our Being is not sufficiently <em>large enough</em> to contain every type of number that exists? If we are always restricted to a particular ordering of things, what is it that stops our Being from overflowing and encapsulating this ordering so that it might be ordered along with all the rest? The answer is that <em>Being is not infinite</em>. A condition for the actualization of the next ordinal number that orders not only all things that exist but the order in which they exist is an infinity upon which to map that next ordinal.</p>
<p>If there were no Death, Being would have the capacity to be complete with respect to the things that are possible, so that possibility would no longer be a thing with any meaning. That we die removes certain possibilities from the possibility of ever attaining actualization.</p>
<p>the inability of human mathematics to capture the totality of numbers in finite symbols is a manifestation of this fundamental truth.</p>
<p>TODO</p>

<h2>The Relation of Being<a class="headerlink" href="#the-relation-of-being" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If Being itself can be said to be anything at all, then it must be a relationship. In other words, Being is a map between the component parts which exist <em>in</em> a complex, i.e. the way in which things are <em>with</em> one another. It follows by necessity that Being must obey the laws of relations<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#appendix-1" id="id6">4</a>. Therefore, we next turn towards the analysis of Being insofar that it is a relation.</p>
<p>A relation between two parts <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> can be written as a symbolic proposition,</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">x</span> <span class="pre">R</span> <span class="pre">y</span></code></p>
<p>We may substitue the relation of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">run</span> <span class="pre">faster</span> <span class="pre">than</span></code> for R, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cheetahs</span></code> for <em>x</em> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">turtles</span></code> for y to obtain a definite proposition from this symbolic form. As another example, we may also substitute relations like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nephew</span> <span class="pre">of</span></code> for R, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Augustus</span></code> for x and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Julius</span></code> for y. Indeed, all dyadic relations can be reduced to this symbolic form, if the appropriate substitutions are made.</p>
<p>Relations have certain properties that define how they operate over the domain of indefinite variables supplied as arguments to them. The <em>theory of relations</em> is the study of these properties when the relation between the parts is left indeterminate, just as the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> are left as indeterminate variables. In other words, the formal inquiry into relations treats relations in the abstract sense, where the exact relation is not considered, but instead is given arbitrarily, so the arguments thus formed will apply to <em>all</em> relations. Being is not exempt from this universality. It is for the reason of enhancing our understanding of Being that we study the properties of relations in this section,</p>
<p>Following <strong>Tarski</strong>, <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#tarski-2" id="id7">6</a> <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#author-1" id="id8">7</a></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>A relation <em>R</em> is called <strong>reflexive in set K</strong> if every element <em>x</em> of the set <em>K</em> has the relation <em>R</em> to itself</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This can be expressed symbolically as,</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">x</span> <span class="pre">R</span> <span class="pre">x</span></code></p>
<p>The relation of numerical equality <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">=</span></code> satisfies this definition, since it is the case <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">1</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">2</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">2</span></code>, etc. Another reflexive relation is seen in the relation of parallelity between lines, if the definition of <em>parallelity of lines</em> is such that lines which have the same direction are considered parallel.</p>
<p>Examples of relations that do not satisfy this definition can be seen in the propositional functions  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">x</span> <span class="pre">precedes</span> <span class="pre">y</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">x</span> <span class="pre">greater</span> <span class="pre">than</span> <span class="pre">y</span></code>, etc. If the arguments are reversed in these relations, they necessarily change the relation implied between its part, i.e. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">x</span> <span class="pre">precedes</span> <span class="pre">y</span></code> is not the same as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">y</span> <span class="pre">precedes</span> <span class="pre">x</span></code>, unless we identify the <em>x</em> in the former proposition with the <em>y</em> in the latter and visa versa.</p>
<p>Reflexivity is an essential condition for equivalence. A relation, whatever its form, cannot be used to express identity if it is not reflexive.</p>

<section id="the-fundamental-problem-of-aristotelian-physics">
<h2>The Fundamental Problem of Aristotelian Physics<a class="headerlink" href="#the-fundamental-problem-of-aristotelian-physics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In attempting to define a thing as existence, we have passed by its Being entirely. For if the Being of a table was reducible to its existence, i.e. its chemical composition, then it should not occur that separate existents should be separate tables, that is to say, if Being were identical to existence, a steel table would be a wholly different Being from the tree stump offered to the midday travellers as their lunch table. It is, however, the case that a table can exist through different mediums and retain its “table-ness”, so that in the account of only its physical properties, we do not touch upon at all what it is that defines a table.</p>
<p>These ambiguities between Being and existnce no doubt result from double duty <em>is</em> performs in our language. For when we say a <em>thing is</em>, we typically mean a <em>thing exists</em>, where as when we say a <em>thing is this</em>, we should understand this proposition as a proposition about its Being.</p>
<p>TODO</p>
<p>Matters are complicated with the introduction of time, for now a thing no longer simply <em>is</em>, but contains a multitude of ways of coming to be: <em>is</em>, <em>was</em>, <em>will be</em>, <em>has been</em>. With this terminology, it becomes clear Being intrinsically contains a dimension of time and space, so that Being is said to be with respect to time and with respect to space.</p>
<p>TODO</p>
<p>The first philosophical analysis of Being of which we are aware comes down to us through the Greek tradition. <strong>Aristotle</strong>, in particular, living more than two thousand years ago, synthesized the works of all that preceded into a single train of though. Despite the age of his works, they have remained throughout history a source of considerable study, in particular his contributions to the so-called <em>primary</em> philosophy, what would be called today <em>ontology</em>, the study of Being itself. The essence of his contributions to untangling of the puzzle of Being are chiefly found in <em>Physics</em> and <em>Metaphysics</em>.</p>
<p>The essential problem is this: A being is on one hand a substance, a material, matter. On the other hand, it is a multiplicity of <em>things</em>. A thing is at once a substance and a representative of something beyond the subtance. For instance, wood is a substance that assumes the form of a table or a chair. In either case, a different thing <em>becomes</em> from the same underlying substance, yet the form of the substance differentiates the <em>things</em> in their thinghood.</p>
<p>The substance signifies through its form its inclusion in a <em>category</em> of Being. This wood <em>is</em> a table; the substance <em>is</em> a thing. But in this, there is, as <strong>Aristotle</strong> was wont to say a puzzle (<em>aporia</em>); for a substance can <em>be</em> many things; the table <em>is</em> brown; the table <em>is</em> three feet high; the table <em>is</em> where meals happen. In each of these <em>beings</em>, there is an element of <em>coincidence</em>, where the particular thing, the table, need not have these <em>attributes</em>. Because of this, there is a <em>category</em> demarcating a space of attributes, of the complete enumeration of possibilities of a given substantial form, encompassing the <em>being</em> of a table, in all its multivariate ways. Being is, in Aristotelian physics, the becoming of Form through Substance.</p>
<p>In this division between Substance and Form, there is a trap that is perhaps impossible to avoid, for it perplexed a millenia of philsophers until the time of <strong>Heidegger</strong>. With the Aristotelian dyad of Substance and Form, we have the beginnings of the so-called mind-body dualism, which was properly synthesized as a framework by <strong>Descartes</strong>, that posits two modes of Being, mapping roughly one-to-one with substance and form, the <em>res extensa</em> and the <em>res cogitans</em>, the Being of the physical and the Being of the mental.</p>
<p>It is this system of thought that mathematizes the physical as pure extension and duration. All things are ordered pairs of attributes and the universe is determined via the changing relationships of its parts. In other words, the <em>res extensa</em>, the Being of substance, is a volume of space changing with respect to time.</p>
<p>The <em>res cogitans</em> is separate from this substance, in the way that we mean it <em>is</em> <em>about</em> the substance. In other words, the Being of the mental, because it <em>is not</em> substance, is <em>insubstantial</em>. In this way, we cannot properly say a table <em>is</em> a table at all, for a table is a mental construct on top of the physical Being of matter, so we must rather say, in a “scientific way”, its physical counterpart is all that is, and all other designations are purely subjective. The thing which we call a table is in reality reduced to natural forces operating on the world-substance; it is a mathematical equilibrium, or atleast temporarily so.</p>
<p>There is an element of truth in this interpretation. How could there not be? It is this insight into the nature of Being that led to great revolutions of mathematics and science seen in the eighteenth and nineteenth century. Yet, we must admit, with respect to our phenomenal experience, this description is somehow lacking. With this interpretation, the table is a table because the Being of the mental designates it so, not because it <em>is</em> a table. If we recall a table need not be constructed by human hand to be a table, for a tree stump or any elevated surface would serve the function just as well, the puzzle becomes clearer.</p>
<p>We here recall the immortal words of the Bard, “A rose by any other name would smell just as sweet.”</p>
<p>TODO</p>
<p>There is yet another way a thing is said to be and that is through the linguistic form of <em>am</em>. The notion of <em>am</em> is no general one to be affixed to an indefinite object, for this Being symbolizes a different type of Being altogether: the first person singular present tense. If language is a set of tools by which we represent ideas, <em>am</em> is an orthogonality to the representative dimensions defined by the other forms of <em>to be</em>, in that it is a form that by necessity requires a conscious subject, a prior not previously required in the semantics of Being.</p>
<p>Likening a proposition to a function, we draw a parallel to mathematics: a function only has meaning over a certain domain in which it makes sense for its operations to be applied; or, from the surjective direction, we may say a certain domain and its projection define the meaning of a function (as Fourier showed, by reducing all functions on a certain interval to infinite series of trigonometric functions, that in aggregate sum to the functions’ range), so that if we say <em>the function which is defined by the mapping between the set of things which do not exist and the set of natural numbers</em>, in some way we have defined what is meant by the notion of zero through this mapping and we may, in some sense, say the meaning of zero is <em>contained</em> in the mapping.</p>
<p>TODO</p>
<p>Likewise, the linguistic notion of <em>am</em> brings with it a certain domain and a certain projection, which clarify its meaning, for the <em>(x,y)</em> in the propositional function <em>x am y</em> cannot be arbitrarily assigned over the space of subject-nouns, over the set of existent things. <em>Am</em> defines a precise and particular subject: <em>us</em>. Specifically, <em>I</em>.</p>
<p>This can be seen in the syntactical error that arises in the proposition <em>the thing am this</em>; the meaning of <em>am</em> is only understood through <em>I am this</em>.</p>
