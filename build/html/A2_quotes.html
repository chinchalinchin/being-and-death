And that there are some such cases is clear. FOr there being a human reciprocates as to implication of being with the true statement about it: if there is a human, the statement whereby we say that there is a human is true, and reciprocally–since if the statement whereby we say there is a human is true, there is a human. And whereas teh true statement is in no way the cause of the thing’s being, the thing does seem in some way to be the cause of the statement’s being true. For it is because of the thing’s being or not being that the statement is called true or false.</p>

<h3>Aristotle: Physics<a class="headerlink" href="#aristotle-physics" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Translated by C.D.C. Reeve</strong></p>
<p>Book II, Chapter 1</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Of beings, some are by nature, while others are due to other causes. THose that are by nature are animals and their parts, plants, and simple bodies–for example, earth, fire, air, and water (for we say that these and things like them are by nature). ALl these things evidently differ from things thtat are not composed by nature. FOr each of them has within itself a starting-point of moving and being at rest–some with respect to place, some with respect to increase and decrease, others with respect to alteration.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>A bed, by contrast, or a clock, or anything else of that kind, insofar as each such predicate applies to it–that is, to the extent that it is a product of craft–has no innate impulse to change. But insofar as it is coincidentally made of stone, earth of a mixture of the two, to taht very extent, it <em>does</em> have one. THis is because nature is a sort of starting-point and cause of moving and being at rest in that to which it belongs primarily, intrinsically, and not coicidentally.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Nature, then, is what has been stated. Andd things that have this sort of starting-point have a nature. And each of them is a substance. FOr a substance is a sort of underlying subject, and a nature is always in an underlying subject. ANd these things are also in accord with nature, as too is whatever belongs intrinsically to them, as spatial movement upward belongs to fire–for this neither is nor has a nature but is by nature and in accord with nature.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>It seems to some people that the nature and substance of each of the beings that are by nature is the first componet present in it, which is intrinsically unshaped–for example, the wood is the nature of the bed, and the bronze of the statue. It is a sign of this, Antiphon says, that if someone were to bury a bed, and the decomposing material were to acquire the capacity to send up a shoot, what came up would not be a bed but wood–his supposition being that the disposition of the material that is in accord with convention and craft knowledge belong coincidentally to the wood, whereas the substance is what remains continuously while these things happen to it. ANd if each of these materials is also related to another in the same way (for example, bronze and gold to water, bones and wood to earth, and similarly too with anything else whatsoever), that <em>that</em> would be their nature and substance.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>THat is why some people say that fire is tha nature of beings, some that earth, air, or water is, and others that all of them, others that some of them, are. For whatever any of these people took to be of this sort–whether it was one or more than one–this or these he declared to be the substance of all things, everything else being attributes, states, or dispositions of these, and declared this or these to be eternal, since they do not change from themselves, whereas other things come to be or pass away an unlimited number of times.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>In one way, then, something is said to be nature when it is the first underlying matter for each of things that have within themselves a starting-point of movement and change.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>In another way, though, what is said to be nature is the shape–that is, the form–that is in accord with the account. FOr just as something is said to be [a work of] craft when it is in accord with craft knowledge and produced by craft, so something is said to be [a work of] nature when it is in accord with nature and produced by nature. And as in the one case we would not yet say that a thing is at all in accord with craft if it is [a work of] craft, so it is in the case of things composed by nature. For what is only potentially flesh or bone, before it acquires the form that is in accord with the account by which we define flesh or bone and say what it is, neither has yet its own nature nor is it by nature. So in this other way the nature is the shape–that is, the form–of things that have wihthin themselves a starting-point of movement, something that is not separable except in account.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Further, when we speak of nature as coming to be, it is as a route to nature [as possessed]. For it is not said of things in the way medical treatment is, which is a route not to the craft of medicine but to health. FOr medical treatment must proceed from the craft of medicine and not to it. But it is not in this way that nature (<em>phusis</em>) [as coming to be] is related to nature [as possessed], rather what is naturally growing (_to phuomenon), insofar as it is naturally growing, proceeds from something to something. What is it, then, that is growing? Not the thing it is growing from, but the one it is growing into. The shape, therefore, is nature.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Book II, Chapter 8</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Further, in whatever has an end, the earlier things, and the ones following them in order, are in action done for its sake. Well then, as things are done in action, so they are in nature, and as they are in nature, so each of them is done in action, provided there is no impediment. In action, though, things are done for the sake of something. Therefore, in nature too they are for the sake of something. FOr example, if a house were one of the things that came to be by nature, it would do so just as it now does by craft. And if things came to be not only by nature but also by craft, they would come to be just as they do by nature. One thing, therefore, is for the sake of another. In general, though, craft in some cases completes the things that nature is incapable of brining to completion, while in others it imitate nature. If, then, what is in accord with craft is for the sake of something, it is clear that what is in accord with nature is as well. FOr in what is in accord with craft and in what is in accord with nature the relation of what comes after to what comes before is the same.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>This is most evident in the case of the other animals, since they do make things either by craft, by carrying out inquiries, or by engaging in deliberations–which is why some people are puzzled as to wehter spiders, ants and things of that sort do what they do by means of understanding or in some other way. ANd if we proceed a little further in this way, it is evident that even in plants things come to be that further the end–for example, leaves for the sake of sahding the fruit. If, then, it is both by nature and for the sake of something that the swallow makes its nest and the spdier its web, and if plants grow for the sake of good, it is evident that this sort of cause is present in things that come to be and are by nature. And since nature is twofold, the one as matter and the other as shape, and since the ;latter is the end, and the other things are for the sake of the end, the cause in the sense of the for-the-sake-of-which must be the shape.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>It is evident, then, that nature is a cause, namely, a cause in the way that the for-the-sake-of-which is.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Book II, Chapter 9</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>As for what is by necessity [in natural things], we must ask whether it is hypothetical, or also unconditional. FOr as things stand it is thought that what is by necessity is found in what comes to be in the way in which someone might suppose that the wall of a house came to be by necessity, because heavy things by nature spatially move downard, and light ones upward. ANd so the stones and the foundations are down below, the clay is up above them because it is lighter, and the wooden logs are on the very top, since they are the lightest. Nevertheless, though the wall does not come to be without these, it did not in fact come to be because of them, except as matter, but rather for the sake of shelter and protection..</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Similarly too in the case of all the other things in which the for-the-sake-of is present: although they could not come to be without things that have a necessary nature, they do not in fact come to be because of these, except as matter, but rather for the sake of something. FOr example, why is a saw such as it is? So that <em>this</em> may be, and for the sake of <em>this</em>. But in fact it is impossible that this thing that the saw is for the sake of should come to be unless it is made of iron. It is necessary, therefore, for it to be made of iron, if there is to be a saw with its function. THe necessity, then, is hypothetical, but not [necessary] as an end. FOr the necessity lies in the matter, whereas the for-the-sake-of-which lies in the account.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The necessity found in mathematics and in things that come to be in accord with nature are in a way quite similar. FOr since the straight is <em>this</em>, it is necessary that the angles of a trinagle should equal two right angles, but not the other way around–even though if the latter does not hold, the straight will not be <em>this</em> either. In things that come to be for the sake of something it is the reverse: if the end is or will be, the previous thigns are or will be too, and just as in mathematics, where if the conclusion does not hold, the starting-point will not either, so here if the previos things are not or will nto be, then neither will the end–that is, the for-the-sake-of-which. FOr the end is itself also a starting-point, although not of action but rather of rational calculation. (In mathematics the starting-point is the starting-point of the rational calculation, since here no actions are involved)</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>And so if there is to be a house, it is necessary for these things to come to be or to be present, and in general the matter that is for the sake of something–for example, bricks and stones if there is to be a house. Yet the end does not exist because of these, except as matter, nor will it exist because of them. In general, however, if they are not present there will be neither house nor saw (in the case of a hosue if the stones are not present, in the case of a saw if the iron is not), just as in mathematics the starting-points will not hold if the triangle does not have [its interior angles equal to] two right angles.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>It is evident, then, that the necessity in natural things is what is called matter and the movements of the matter. And the natural scientists should state both causes, but most of all the for-the-sake-of-which. FOr this is the cause of the matter, not the matter of the end. ANd the end is the for-the-sake-of-which, and the starting-point is from the definition and account, as in the things that are in accord with craft. FOr example, since a house is such-and-such sort of thing, these thigns msut come to be or be present of necessity, or since health is <em>this</em>, these things must come to be or be present of necessity–and similarly if a human is <em>this</em>, these must be, and if these, these others. Presumably, though, necessity is also present in the account. FOr suppose the function of sawing is defined as such-and-such sort of division, well, it will not occur unless the saw has teeth of such-and-such a sort, and these cannot be of such-and-such a sort unless they are made of iron. FOr even in the account there are parts that stand as matter of account.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Book III, Chapter 1</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>It is clear, then, that movement is this, and that is exists when the actuality itself does, and neither earlier nor later. FOr each thing [of this sort] admits of sometimes being active, sometimes not–for example, the buildable insofar as it is buildable. ANd the activation of the buildable insofar as it is buildable is building. FOr the activity is either this–the building– or the house. But when the house exists it is no longer buildable: what is buildable is what is [fpr] <em>being built</em>. It is necessary, therefore, for building to be the activity, and building is a sort of movement. ANd the same account also applies in the case of the other movements.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Book III, Chapter 3</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Also evident, and a point that raises a puzzle, is that movement is in the thing moved, since movement is the actualization of the moveable by what can in fact move something. And the activation of what is capable of moving something is no other than this. For there must be the actulaization of both, since it <em>can move</em> something by having the potentiality to do so, and it <em>is moving</em> it by being active. But it is on the moveable that the mover is capable of acting, so that the activation of both alike is one, just like the interval from one to two and from two to one, or the hill up and the hill down. For these thingss are one, but their account is not one. And similarly in the case of the mover and the moved.</p>

<p>Part IV</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>I noticed that whilst I thus wished to think all things false, it was absolutely essential that the ‘I’ who thought this should be somewhat, and remarking that this truth ‘<em>I think, therefore I am</em>’ was so certain and so assured that all the most extravagant suppositions brought forward by the sceptics were incapable of shaking it, I came to the conclusion that I could receive it without scruple as the first principle of the Philosophy for which I was seeking.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>And then, examining attentively that which I was, I saw that I could conceive that I had no body, and that there was no world nor place where I might be; but yet that I could not for all that conceive that I was not. On the contrary, I saw from the very fact that I thought of doubting the truth of other things, it very evidently and certainly followed that I was; on the other hand, if I had only ceased from thinking, even if all the rest of what I had ever imagined had really existed, I should have no reason for thinking that I had existed. From that I knew that I was a substance the whole essence or nature of which is to think, and that for its existence there is no need of any place, nor does it depend on any material thing; so that this ‘me’, that is to say, the soul by which I am what I am, is entirely distinct from body, and is even more easy to know than is the latter; and even if body were not, the sould would not cease to be what it is.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>And having remarked that there was nothing at all in the statement: ‘<em>I think, therefore I am</em>’ which assures me of having thereby made a true assertion excepting that I see very clearly that to think it is necessary to be.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>In addition to this, I had ideas of many things which are sensible and corporeal, for, although I might suppose that I was dreaming, and that all that I saw or imagined was false, I could not at the same time deny that the ideas were really in my thoughts. But because I had already recognized very clearly in myself that the nature of intelligence is distinct from that of the body, and observing that all composition gives evidence of dependency, and that dependency is manifestly an imperfection, I came to the conclusion that it could not be a perfection in God to be composed of these two natures, and that consequently He was not so composed.</p>

<h3>Schopenhauer, Arthur: The World as Will and Representation<a class="headerlink" href="#schopenhauer-arthur-the-world-as-will-and-representation" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Book 1: The World as Representation, First Aspect, Chapter 1</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“The world is my representation”: this is a truth valid with reference to every living and knowing being, although man alone can bring it into reflective, abstract consciousness. If he really does so, philosophical discernment has dawned on him. It then becomes clear and certain to him that he does not know a sun and an earth, but only an eye that sees a sun, a hand that feels an earth; that the world around him is there only as representation, in other words, only in reference to another thing, namely that which represents, and this is himself. If any truth can be expressed “a priori”, it is this; for it is the statement of that form of all possible and conceivable experience, a form that is more general than all others, than time, space and causality, for all these presuppose it. While each of these forms, which we have recognized as so many particular modes of the principle of sufficient reason, is valid only for a particular class of representations, the division into object and subject, on the other hand, is the common form of all those classes; it is that form under which alone any representation, of whatever kind it be, abstract or intuitive, pure or empirical, is generally possible and conceivable. Therefore no truth is more certain, more independent of all others, and less in need of proof than this, namely that everything that exists for knowledge, and hence the whole of this world, is only object in relation to the subject, perception of the perceiver, in a word, representation. Naturally this holds good of the present as well as of the past and future, of what is remotest as well as of what is nearest; for it holds good of time and space themselves, in which alone all these distinctions arise. Everything that in anyway belongs and can belong to the world is inevitably associated with this being-conditioned by the subject, and it exists only for the subject. The world is representation.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Book 1: The World as Representation, First Aspect, Chapter 2</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>That which knows all things and is known by none is the “subject”. It is accordingly the supporter of the world, the universal condition of all that appears, of all objects, and it is always presupposed; for whatever exists, exists only for the subject. Everyone finds himself as this subject, yet only in so far as he knows, not in so as he is object of knowledge. But his body is already object, and therefore from this point of view we call it representation. For the body is object among objects and is subordinated to the laws of objects, although it is immediate object. Like all objects of perception, it lies within the forms of all knowledge, in time and space through which there is plurality. But the subejct, the knower never the known, does not lie within these forms; on the contrary, it is always presupposed by those forms themselves, and hence neither plurality nor its opposite, namely unity, belongs to it. We never know it, but it is precisely that which knows wherever there is knowledge.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Therefore the world as representaion, in which aspect alone we are here considering it, has two essential, necessary, and inseparable halves. The one half is the obejct, whose forms are space and time, and through these plurality. But the other half, the subject, does not lie in space and time, for it is whole and undivided in every representing being. Hence a single one of these beings with the object completes the world as representation just as fully as do the millions that exist. And if that single one were to disappear, then the world as representation would no longer exist. Therefore these halves are inseparable even in thought, for each of the two has meaning and existence only through and for the other; each exists with the other and vanishes with it. They limit each other immediately; where the object begins, the subject ceases. The common or reciprocal nature of this limitation is seen in the very fact that the essential, and hence universal, forms of evey object, namely space, time, and causality, can be found and fully known, starting from the subject, even without the knoweldge of the object itself, that is to say, in Kant’s language, they reside “a priori” in our consciousness.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Appendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“Kant’s greatest merit is the distinction of the phenomenon from the thing-in-itself”, based on the proof that between things and us always stands the “intellect”, and that on this account they cannot be known according to what they may be in themselves. He was led on to this path by Locke. Locke had shown that the secondary qualities of things, such as sound, odour, colour, hardness, softness, smoothness and the like, founded on the affections of the senses, do not belong to the objective body, the thing-in-itself. To this, on the contrary, he attributed only the primary qualities, i.e. those that presuppose merely space and impenetrability, and so extension, shape, solidity, number, mobility.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Kant explains all that Locke had admitted as “qualitates primariae”, that is, as qualities of the thing-in-itself, as also belonging merely to its phenomenon in our faculty of perception or apprehension, and this just because the condition of this faculty, namely space, time and causality are known by us “a priori”. Thus Locke had abstracted from the thing-in-itself the share that the sense-organs have in its phenomenon; but Kant further abstracted the share of the brain-functions (although not under the name). In this way, the distinction between the phenomenon and the thing-in-itself obtained an infinitely greater significance and a very much deeper meaning. For this purpose he had to take in hand the great separation of our “a priori” from our “a posteriori” knowledge, which before him had never been made with proper precision and completeness or with clear and conscious knowledge.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>This world that appears to the senses has no true being, but only a ceaseless becoming; it is, and it also is not; and its comprehension is not so much a knowledge as an illusion.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Kant showed that the laws which rule with inviolable necessity in existence, i.e. in experience generally, are not to be applied to deduce and explain “existence” itself; that their validity is therefore only relative, in other words, begins only after existence, the world of experience generally, is already settled and established; that in consequence these laws cannot be our guiding line when we come to the explanation of the existence of the world and of ourselves. All previous Western philosophers had imagined that these laws, according to which all phenomena are connected to one another, and all of which–time and space as well as causality and inference–I comprehend under the expression the principle of sufficient reason, were absolute laws conditioned by nothing at all, “aeternae veritates”; that the world itself existed only in consequence of and in conformity with them; and that under their guidance the whole riddle of the world must therefore be capable of solution. The assumptions made for this purpose, which Kant criticizes under the name of the Ideas of reason, really served only to raise the mere “phenomenon”, the work of Maya, the shadow-world of Plato, to the one highest reality, to put it in place of the innermost and true essence of things, and thus to render the real knowledge thereof impossible, in a word, to send the dreamers still more soundly to sleep. Kant showed that those laws, and consequently the world itself, are conditioned by the subject’s manner of knowing. From this followed that, however far one might investigate and infer under the guidance of these laws, in the principal matter, i.e. in the knowledge of the inner nature of the world in itself and outside the representation, no step forward was made, but one moved merely like a squirrel in his wheel.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>It can be also be said that Kant’s teaching gives us insight that the beginning and end of the world are to be sought not without us, but rather within.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>From this it follows also that the objective world as we know it does not belong to the true being of things-in-themselves, but is its mere “phenomenon”, conditioned by those very forms that lie “a priori” in the human intellect (i.e, the brain), hence the world cannot contain anything but phenomena.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>It is true that Kant did not arrive at the knowledge that the the phenomenon is the world as representation and that the thing-in-itself is the will. He showed, however, that the phenomenal world is conditioned just as much by the subject as by the object, and by isolating the most universal forms of its phenomenon, i.e., of the representation, he demonstrated that we know these forms and survey them according to their whole constitutional nature not only by starting from the object, but just as well by starting from the subject, since they are really the limit between the obejct and subject and are common to both. He concluded that, by pursuing this limit, we do not penetrate into the inner nature of the object or the subject, and consequently that we never know the essential nature of the world, namely the thing-in-itself.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>(1) Metaphysics is the science of that which lies beyond the possibility of all experience. (2) Such a thing can never be found according to fundamental principles that are themselves first drawn from experience; but only what we know “prior to”, and hence “independently of”, experience can reach farther than possible experience. (3) In our reason, some fundamental principles of the kind are actually to be found; they are comprehended under the name of knowledge from pure reason. So far Kant agrees with his predecessors, but now he parts company from them. They say: “These fundamental principles, or knowledge from pure reason, are expressions of the absolute possibility of things, “aeternae veritates”, sources of ontology; they stand above the world-order, just as the ancients fate stood above the gods.” Kant says that they are mere forms or our intellect, laws, not of the existence of things, but of our representations of them; therefore they are valid merely for our apprehension of things, and accordingly cannot extend beyond the possibility of experience, which is what was aimed at according to the first assumoption. For it is precisely the “a priori” nature of these forms of knowledge, since it can ret only on their subjective origin, that cuts us off forever from knowledge of the being-in-itself of thigns, and confines us to a world of mere phenomena, so that we cannot know things as they may be in themselves, even “a posteriori”, not to mention “a priori”. Accordingly, metaphysics is impossible, and in its palce we have criticism of pure reason.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The world and our own existence present themselves to us necessarily as a riddle. It is now assumed, without more ado, that the solution of this riddle cannot result from a thorough understanding of the world itself, but must be looked for in something quite different from the world (for this is the meaing of “beyond the possbility of all expereince”); and that everythign of whic we can in any way have “imemdiate” knowledge (for this is the meaning of possible experience, inner as well as outer) must be excluded from that solution. On the contrary, this solution must be sought only in what we can arrive at merely indirectly, namely by means of inferences from universal principles “a priori”. After the principal source of all knowledge had thus been excluded, and the direct path to truth closed, it is not surprising that the dogmatic attemtps failed, and that Kant was able to demonstrate the necessity of this failure. FOr it had been assumed beforehand that metaphysics and knwoledge “a priori” were identical; yet for this it would have been necessary first to demonstrate that the material for solving the riddle of the world cannot possibly be contained in the world itself, but is to be sought only outside it, in something we can reach only under the guidance of those forms of which are “a priori” conscious.</p>

<div><p>Only through the possibility of something not being wise does the assertion that Solon is wise gain a sense. The content of a concept diminishes as its extension grows; if the latter becomes all-embracing, then the content must be lost entirely.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Whilst we can combine “Solon was wise” and “Thales was wise” into “Solon and Thales were wise”, we cannot say, “Solon and Thales were one”. The impossibility of this would not be perceived if “one” as well as “wise” were a property both of Solon and Thales”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>If I say, “Venus has 0 moons”, then there is no moon or aggregate of moons to assert anything of at all; but instead it is the concept ‘moon of Venus’ to which a property is ascribed, namely, that of including nothing under it.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>That a statement of number expresses something factual independent of our conceptions can only surprise those who regard a concept as something subjective like an idea. But this view is wrong. If, for example, we subordinate the concept of body to the concept of what has weight, or the concept of whale to the concept of mammal, then we are thereby asserting something objective. Now if the concepts were subjective, then the subordination of one to the other, as a relation between them, would also be subjective, just as a relation between ideas.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>If, for example, all concepts under which only one object falls, are collected under one concept, then oneness is a mark of this concept. Under it would fall, for example, the concept “moon of the Earth”, though not the heavenly body itself. Thus, a concept can fall under a higher one, that is to say, a concept of second order.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><sup><sub>Here is the historical moment where logic first turned towards its own foundations. Here is where the representative form of mathematics began its recursive journey inwards, towards itself.</sub></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>In fact, would it not be most appropriate to call a concept the unit that relates to the Number which belongs to it? We can then give a sense to assertions that are made about the unit, that it is separated from its surroundings and indivisible. For the concept to which the number is ascribed does in general delimit what falls under it in a definite way. The concept “letter in the word ‘Zahl’” delimits the Z from the a, the a from the h, and so on. The concept “syllable in the word ‘Zahl’” picks out the word as a whole and as indivisible in the sense that the parts do not now fall under the concept.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Section IV: The Concept of Number</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>All that can be demanded of a concept on the part of logic and for rigour of proof is its sharp boundary, that for every object it is determined whether it falls under the concept or not. Now this demand is completely satisifed by a concept containing a contradiction such as “not identical with itself”; since of every object it is known that it does not fall under such a concept.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Section V: Conclusion</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The laws of number will not need, as Baumann thinks, to prove their worth in practice in order to be applicable to the external world; for in the external world, in the totality of the spatial, there are no concepts, no properties of concepts, no numbers. The laws of number are thus not really applicable to external things: they are not laws of nature. But they are certainly applicable to judgements that are made about things in the external world: they are laws of laws of nature.</p>

<p>Section II: The Elaboration of the Question</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>What is the nothing? Our very first approach to this question has something unusual about it. In our asking we posit the nothing in advance as something that “is” such and such; we posit it as a being. But that is exactly what it is distinguished from. Interrogating the nothing–asking what and how it, the nothing, is–turns what is interrogated into its opposite. The question deprives itself of its own object. Accordingly, every answer to this question is also impossible from the start. For it necessarily assumes the form: the nothing “is” this or that. With regard to the nothing, question and answer alike are inherently absurd.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>For thinking, which is always essentially thinking about something, must act in a way contrary to its own essence when it thinks of the nothing.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Does not the “not”, negatedness, and thereby negation too represent the higher determiniation under which the nothing falls as a particular kind of negated matter? Is the nothing given only because the “not”, i.e. negation, is given? Or is it the other way around? Are negation and the “not” given only because the nothing is given? That has not been decided; it has not even been raised expressly as a question. We assert that the nothing is more original than the “not” and negation.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>If this thesis is right, then the possibility of negation as an act of the intellect, and thereby the intellect itself, are somehow dependent upon the nothing. Then how can the intellect hope to decide about the nothing? Does the ostensible absurdity of question and answer with respect to the nothing in the end rest solely in a blind conceit of the far-ranging intellect?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>If nothing itself is to be questioned as we have been questioning it, then it must be given beforehand. We must able to encounter it.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Where shall we seek the nothing?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The nothing is the complete negation of the totality of beings.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>As surely as we can never comprehend absolutely the whole of beings in themselves we certainly do find ourselves stationed in the midst of beings that are revealed somehow as a whole. In the end an essential distinction prevails between comprehending the whole of beings in themselves and finding oneself in the midst of beings as a whole.</p>

<p>Introduction, Chapter I: Exposition of the Question of the Meaning of Being, Section 3: The Formal Struture of the Question of Being</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>What we seek when we inquire into Being is not something entirely unfamiliar, even if at first we cannot grasp it at all.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>When we come to what is to be interrogated, the question of Being requires that the right way of access to entities shall have been obtained and secured in advance.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Introduction, Chapter I: Exposition of the Question of the Meaning of Being, Section 4: The Ontical Priority of the Question of Being</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>So far as existence is the determining character of the Dasein, the ontological analytic of this entity always requires that existentiality be considered beforehand. By “existentiality” we understand the state of Being that is constitutive for those entities that exist. But in the idea of such a constitutive state of Being, the idea of Being is already included. And thus even the possbility of carrying through the analytic of Dasein depends on working out beforehand the question about the meaning of Being in general.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Sciences are aways of Being in which Dasein comports itself towards entities which it need not be itself. But to Dasein, Being in a world is something that belongs essentially. Thus Dasein’s understanding of Being pertains with equal primordiality both to an understanding of something like a “world”, and to the understanding of the Being of those entities which become accessible within the world. So whenever an ontology takes for its theme entities whose character of Being is other than that of Dasein, it has its own foundation and motivation in Dasein’s own ontical structure, in which a pre-ontological understanding of Being is comprised as a definite characteristic.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Dasein accordingly takes priority  over all other entities in several ways. THe first priority is an ontical one: Dasein is an entity whose Being has the determinate character of existence. The second priority is an ontological one: Dasein is in itself “ontological”, because existence is thus determinative for it. But with equal primordiality Dasein also possesses–as constitutive for its understanding of existence–an understand of the BEing of all entities of a character other than its own. Dasein has therefore a third priority as providing the ontico-ontological condition for the possibility of any ontologies.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Introduction, Chapter II: The Twofold Task in Working Out the Question of Being. Method and Design of our Investigation, Section 6: The Task of Destroying the History of Ontology</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>In its factical Being, any Dasein is as it already was, and it is “what” it already was.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>When Dasein understand either itself of Being in general, it does so in terms of the “world”.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>We understand this task as one in which by taking “the question of BEing as our clue” we are to “Destory” the traditional content of ancient ontology until we arrive at those primordial experiences in which we achieved our first ways of determining the nature of Being.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Introduction, Chapter II: The Twofold Task in Working Out the Question of Being. Method and Design of our Investigation, Section 7: The Phenomenological Method of Investigation</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The expression “phenomenology” signifies primarily a “methodological concepttion”.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The more genuinely a methodological concept is worked out and the more comprehensively it determine sthe principles on which a science is to be conducted ,all the more primordially is it rooted i nthe way we come to terms with the things themselves, and the farther is it removed from what we call “technical devices”, though there are many such devices even in the theoretical disciplines.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Thus we must keep in mind that the epxression “phenomenon” signifies that which shows itself in itself, the manifest.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Only when the meaning of something is such that it makes a pretension of showing itself–that is, of being a phenomenon–can it show itself as something which it is not; only then can it “merely look like so-and-so”.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Appearing is an announcing-itself through something that shows itself. IF one then says that with the word “appearance” we allude to something wherein something appears without being itself an apperance, one has thereby defined the concept of phenomenon: one has rather presupposed it.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>According to this, phenomena are never appearances, though on the other hand every apperance is dependent on phenomena.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>So again the expression “appearance” itself can have a double-signification: first, “appearing”, in the sense of announcing-itself, as not-showing-itself; and next, that which does the announcing–that which in its showing-itself indicates something which does not show itself. ANd finally one can use “appearing” as a term for the genuine sense of “phenomenon” as showing-itself. If one designates these three different thigns as “appearance”, bewilderment is unavoidable.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“Phenomenon”, the showing-itself-in-itself, signifies a distinctive way in which something can be encountered. “Appearance”, on the other hand, means a reference-relationship which is in an entity itself, and which is such that what does the referring (or the announcing) can fulfill its possible function only if it shows itself in itself and is thus a “phenomenon”.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Thus the term “phenomenology” is quite different in its meaning from expressions such as “theology” and the like. Those terms designate the objects of their respective sciences according to the subject matter which they comprise at the time. “Phenomenology” neither designates the object of its researches, nor characterizes the subject-matter thus comprised. The word merely informs us of a the “how” with which “what” is to be treated in this science gets exhibited and handled. To have a science “of” phenomena means to grasp its objects in such a way that everything about them which is up for discussion must be treated by exhibiting it directly and demonstrating it directly. THe expression “descriptive phenomenology”, which is at the bottom tautological, has the same meaning.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Now what must be taken into account if the formal conception of phenomenon is to be deformalized into the phenomenological one and how is this latter to be distinguised from the ordinary conception? WHat is it taht phenomenology is to “let us see”? WHat is it that must be called a “phenomenon” in a distinctive sense? WHat is it that by its very essence is necessarily the theme whenever we exhibit something explicitly? Manifestly, it is somethign that proximally and for the msot part does not show itself at all: it is somethign that lies hidden, in contract to that which proximally and for the most part does show itself, and it belongs to it so essentially as to constitute its meaning and its ground.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Yet that which remains hidden in an egregious snes, or which relapses and gets covered up again, or which shwos itself only “in disguise”, is not just this entity of that, but rather the Being of entities, as our previous observations have shown.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Only as phenomenology, is ontology possible. In the phenomenological conception of “phenomenon”, what one has in mind s that which shows itself is the Being of entities, its meaning, its modifications and derivatives. And this showing-tself is not just any showing-itself, nor is it some such thing as appearing. Least of all can the Being of entities ever be anythign such that “behind it” stands something else “which does not appear”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Now that we have delimited our preliminary conception of phenomenology, the terms “phenomenal” and “phenomenological” can also be fixed in their signification. That which is given and explicable in the way the phenomenon is encountered is called “phenomenal”; this is what we have in mind we talk about “phenomenal structures”. Everything which belongs to the species of exhibiting and explicating and which goes to make up the way of conveing demanded by this research, is called “phenomenological”.</p>

<p>Chapter 1: Speculative Philosophy, Section II</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>In philosophic theory there is an ultimate which is actual in virtue of its accidents. It is only then capable of characterization through its accidental embodiments, and apart from these accidents is devoid of actuality. In the philosophy of organism this ultimate is termed “creativity”; and God is its primordial, non-temporal (non-historical) accident. In monistic philosophies, Spinoza’s or absolute idealism, this ultimate is God, who is also equivalently termed “The Absolute”. In such monistic schemes, the ultimate is illegimately allowed a final, “eminent” reality, beyond that ascribed to any of its accidents. In this general position the philosophy of organism seems to approximate more to some strains of Indian, or Chinese thought, than to western Asiatic, or European, thought. One side makes process ultimate; the other side makes fact ultimate.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Chapter 1: Speculative Philosophy, Section V</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The point is that every proposition refers to a universe exhibiting some general systematic metaphysical character. Apart from this background, the separate entities which go to form the proposition, and the proposition as a whole, are without determinate character. Nothing has been defined, because every definite entity requires a systematic universe to supply its requisite status. Thus every proposition proposing a fact must, in its complete analysis, propose the general character of the universe required for that fact. There are no self-sustained facts, floating in nonentity.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>One practical aim of metaphysics is the accurate analysis of propositions; not merely of metaphysical propositions, but of quite ordinary propositions such as “There is beef for dinner today” and “Socrates is mortal”. The one genus of facts which constitutes the field of some special sciences requires some common metaphysical presupposition respecting the universe.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Language is thoroughly indeterminate, by reason of the fact that every occurrence presupposes some systematic type of environment.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The truth itself is nothing else than how the composite nature of the organice actualities of the world obtain adequate representations in the divine nature.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Chapter 1: Speculative Philosophy, Section VI</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Whenever we attempt to express the matter of immediate experience, we find that its understanding leads us beyond itself, to its contemporaries, to its past, to its future, and to the universals in terms of which its definiteness is exhibited. But such universals, by their very character of universality, embody the potentiality of other facts with variant types of definiteness. Thus the understanding of the immediate brute fact requires its metaphysical interpretation as an item in the world with some systematic relation to it. When thought comes upon the scene, it finds the intreperations as matters of practice. Philosophy does not initiate interpretations. Its search for a rationalistic scheme is the search for more adequate criticism, and for more adequate justifications of the interpretations which we perforce employ. Our habitual experience is a complex of failure and success in the enterprise of interpretation. If we desire a record of uninterpreted experience, we must ask a stone to record its autobiography. Every scientific memoir in its records of the “facts” is shot through and through with interpretation. The methodology of rational interpretation is the product of the fitful vagueness of consciounsess. Elements which shine with immediate distinctness, in some circumstances, retire into pneumbral shadow in other circumstances, and into black darkness on other occasions. And yet all occasions proclaim themselves as actualities within the flux of a solid world, demanding a unity of interpretation.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Philosophy is the self-correction by consciousness of its own initial experience of subjectivity.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Religion is an ultimate craving to infuse into the insistent particularity of emotion that non-temporal generality which primarily belongs to conceptual thought alone.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Religion is centered upon the harmony of rational thought with the sensitive reaction to the percepta from which experience originates. Science is concerned with the harmony of rational thought with the percepta themselves. When sciences deals with emotions, the emotions in question are percepta and not immediate passions–other people’s emotions and not our own; at least our own in recollection, and not in immediacy. Religion deals with the formation of the experiencing subject; whereas science deals with the objects, which are the data forming the primary phase in this experience. The subject originates from, and amid, given conditions; sciences conciliates thought with this primary matter of fact; and religion conciliates the thought involved in the process with the sensitive reaction involved in that same process. The process is nothing else than the experiencing subject itself. In this explanation it presumed that an experiencing subject is one occasion of sensitive reaction to an actual world. Science finds religious experiences among its percepta; and religion finds scientific concepts among the conceptual experiences to be fused with particular sensitive reactions.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The conclusion of this discusssion is, first, the assertion of the old doctine that breadth of thought reacting with intensity of sensitive experience stands out as an utlimate claim of existence.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>There are simplicities connected with the motion of a bar of steel which are obscured if we refuse to abstract from the individual molecules; and there are certain simplicites concerning the behaviour of men which are obscured if we refuse to abstract from the individual peculiarities of particular specimens. In the same way, there are certain general truths, about actual things in the common world of activity, which will be obscured when attention is confined to some paritcular detailed mode of considering them. These general truths, involved in the meaning of every particular notion respecting the actions of things, are the subject matter for speculative philosophy.</p>

<blockquote>
<div><p>There are people who are destined to taste only the poison in things, from whom any surprise is a painful surprise and any experience a new occasion for torture. If someone were to say to me that such suffering has subjective reasons, relative to the individual’s particular makeup, I would then ask: Is there an objective criterion for evaluating suffering? Who can say with precision that my neighbor suffers more than I do or that Jesus suffered more than all of us? There is no objective standard because suffering cannot be measured according to the external stimulation or local irritation of the organism, but only as it is felt and reflected in conciousness. Alas, from this point of view, any hierarchy is out of the question. Each person remains with his own suffering, which he believes absolute and unlimited. How much would we diminish our personal suffering if we were to compare it to all the world’s sufferings until now, to the most horrifying agonies and the most complicated tortues, the most cruel deaths and the most painful betrayals, all the lepers, all those burned alive or starved to death? Nobody is comforted in his sufferings by the thought that we are all mortals, nor does anybody who suffers really find comfort in the past or present suffering of others. Because in this organically insufficient and fragmentary world, the individual is set to live fully, wishing to make of his own existence an absolute. Each subjective existence is absolute to itself. For this reason each man lives as if he were the center of the universe or the center of history. Then how could his suffering fail to be absolute? I cannot understand another’s suffering in order to diminish my own. Comparisons in such cases are irrelevant, because suffering is an interior state, in which nothing external can help.</p>

<p>Introduction: Pursuit of Being, Chapter 1: The Origin of Negation, Section V: The Origin of Nothingness</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>If Nothingness can be conceived neither outside of Being, nor in terms of Being, and if on the other hand, since it is non-being, it cannot derive from itself the necessary force to “nihiliate itself”, “where does Nothingness come from”?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>I take refuge in reflecton, but the latter has only an undetermined future to offer. This means that in establishing a certyain conduct as a possbility and precisely becasue it is “my” possbility, I am aware that “nothing” can compel me to adopt taht conduct. Yet I am indeed already there in the future; it is for the sake of that being which I will be there at the turning of the path that I now exert all my strength, and in this sense there is already a relation between my future being and my present being. But a “nothingness” has slipped into the heart of this relation; I “am” not the self which I will be. First I am not that self because time separates me from it. Secondly, I am not that self because what I am is not the foundation of what I will be. Finally I am not self because no actual existent can determine strictly what I am going to be.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>I am the self which I will be, in the mode of not being it.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>If “nothing” compels me to save my life, <em>nothing</em> prevents me from precipitating myself into the abyss</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Thus the self which I am depends on the self which I am not yet to the exact extent that the self which I am not yet does not depend on the self which I am.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>We must recognize that there is never a motive “in” consciousness; motives are only “for” consciousness. And due to the very fact that the motive can arise only as appearance, it constitutes itself as ineffective. Of course it does not have externality of a temporal-spatial thing; it always belong to subjectivity and it is apprehended as “mine”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Chapter 1: Immediate Structures of the For-Itself, Section I: Presence to Self</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Presence to self, on the contrary, supposes that an impalpable fissure has slipped into being. If being is present to itself, it is because it is not wholly itself. Presence is an immediate deterioration of coincidence, for it supposes separation. But if we ask ourselves at this point “what it is” which separates the subject from himself, we are forced to admit it is “nothing”. Ordinarily what separates is a distance in space, a lapse in time, a psychological difference, or simply the individuality of two co-presents–in short, a “qualified” reality. But in the case which concerns us, ‘nothing’ can separate the consciousness of belief from belief, since belief is “nothing other” than the consciousness of belief.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Nothingness is always an elsewhere. It is the obligation for the for-istelf never to exist except in the form of an elswhere in relation to itself, to exist as a being which perpetually effects in itself a break in being; it is onyl a perpetual reference of self to self, of the reflection to the reflecting, of the reflecting to the reflection. This reference, however, does not provoke an infinite movement in the heart of the for-itself but is given within the unity of a single act. The infinite movement belongs only to the reflective regard which wants to apprehend the phenomenon as a totality and which is referred from the reflection to the reflecting, from the reflecting to the reflection without being able to stop. Thus nothingness is this hole in being, this fall of the in-itself toward the self, the fall by which the for-itself is constituted.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Nothingness is the putting into question of being by being–that is, precisely consciousness or for-itself. It is an absolute event which comes to being by means of being and which, without having being, is perpetually sustained by being. Since being-in-itself is isolated in its being by its total positivity no being can produce being and nothing can happen to being through being–except for nothingness. Nothingness is the peculiar possibility of being and its unique possibility. Yet this original possibility appears only in the absolute act which realizes it. Since nothingness is nothingness of being, it can come to being only through being itself. Of course it comes to being through a particular being, which is human reality. But this being is constituted as human reality inasmuch as this being is nothign but the original project of its own nothingness. Human reality is being in so far as within its being and for its being it is the unique foundation of nothingess at the heart of being.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>We know the question posed by physiologists: “How can we set upright the objects which are painted upside down on our retina?” We know as well the answer of the philosophers: “There is no problem. An object is upright or inverted in relation to the rest of the universe. To perceive the whole universe inverted means nothing, for it would have to be inverted in relation to something.” But what paritcularly interests us is the origin of this false problem. It is the fact that people have wanted to link my consciousness of objects to the body of the Other. Here are the candle, the crystalline lens, the inverted image on the screne of the retina. But to be exact, the retina enters here into a physical system: it is a “screen” and only that; the crystalline lens is a <em>lens</em> and only a lens; both are homogeneous in their being with the candle which completes the system. Therefore we have deliberately chosen the physical point of view–i.e., the point of view of the outside, of exteriority–in order to study the problem of vision; we have considered a dead eye in the midst of the visible world in order to account for the visibility of this world. Consequently, how can we be surprised later when consciousness, which is absolute interiority, refuses to allow itself to be beound to this object? The relations which I establish between the Other”s body and the external object are really existing relations, but they have for their being the being of the for-others.</p>

<p>Section 14</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Imagine someone saying: “All tools serve to modify something. Thus the hammer modifies the position of the nail, the saw the shape of the board, and so on.”–And what is modified by the rule, the glue-pot, the nails?–“Our knowledge of a thing’s length, the temperature of the glue, the solidity of the box.”–Would anything be gained by this assimilation of expressions?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Section 15</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The word “to signify” is perhaps used in the most straight-forward way when the objet signified is marked with the sign.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>It is in this and more or less similar ways that a name means and is given to a thing–It will often prove useful in philosophy to say to ourselves: naming something is like attaching a label to a thing.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Section 18</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Ask yourself if our language is complete;–whether is was so before the symbolism of chemistry and the notation of the infinitesmial calculus were incorporated in it; for these are, so tp speak, suburbs of our language. (And how many houses or streets does it take before a town begins to be a town?) Our langague can be seen as an ancient city: a maze of little streets and squares, of old and new houses, and of houses with additions from various periods; and this surrounded by a multitude of new boroughs with straight regular streets and uniform houses.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Section 22</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Frege’s idea that every assertion contains an assumption, which is the thing that is asserted, really rests on the possibility found in our language of writing every statement in the form: “It is asserted that such-and-such is the case.”–But “that such-and-such is the case” is not a sentence in our language–so far it is not a “move” in the language-game. And I write, not “It is asserted that …” but, “It is asserted: such-and-such is the case”, the words “it is asserted” simply become superfluous.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>We might very well also write every statement in the form of a question followed by a “Yes”; for instance, “Is it raining? Yes!” Would this shew that every statement contains a question?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Author’s note</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p>Section 27</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“We name things and then we can talk about them: can refer to them in talk.” –As if what we did next were given with the mere act of naming. As if there were only one thing called “talking about a thing”. Whereas in fact we do the most various things with our sentences. Think of the exclamations alone, with their completely different functions: “Water!”, “Away!”, Ow!”, “Help!”, “Fine!”, “No!”. Are you still included to call these words “names of objects”?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div><p>We are brought up, trained, to ask: “What is that called?” –upon which the name is given. And there is also a language-game of inventing a name for something, hence of saying, “This is …” and then using the new name. (Thus, for example, children give names to their dools and then talk about them and to them. Think in this connexion how singular is the use of a person’s name to call him!)</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Section 28</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Now one can ostensively define a proper name, the name of a colour, the name of a material, a numeral, the name of a point of the compass and son. THe definition of the number two, “That is called ‘two’”–point to two nuts–is perfectly exact.–But how can two be defined like that? The person one gives the definition to doesn’t know what one wants to call “two”; he will suppose that “two” is the name given to “this” group of nuts!–He “may” suppose this; but perhaps he does not. He might make the opposite mistake; when I want to assign a name to this group of nuts, he might understand it as a numeral. And he might equally well take the name of a person, of which I give an ostensive definition, as that of a colour, of a race, or even of a point of the compass. That is to say: an ostensive definition can be variously interpretted in every case.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Section 29</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Perhaps you say: two can onyl be ostensively defined in this way: “This number is called ‘two’”. For the word “number” her shews what place in language, in grammar, we assign to the word. But this means that the word”number” must be explained before the ostensive definition can be understood.–The word “number” in the definition does indeed shew this place; does shew the post at which we station the word. ANd we can prevent misunderstandsings by saying: “This colour is called so-and-so”, “this length is called so-and-so”, and so on. THat is to say: musunderstandings are sometimes averted in this way. But is there only one way of taking the word” oclor “ or “length”?–Well, they just need defininig–DEfining, then, by means of other words! And what about the last definition in this cahin? (Do not say: “There isn’t a ‘last’ definition.” That is just as if you chose to say: “There isn’t a last house in this road; one can always build an additional one.”</p>
