<p>TODO</p>
<p>Each of us comes to the table, in the coincidentally literal <em>and</em> figurative sense, with an innate understanding of what it means <em>to be</em>. We do it, <em>be</em> that is, without so much as thought. In fact, this is the first point we should make in this section’s analysis: Being doesn’t require thought. Consciousness is not the determinative factor in our ability to be. This proposition runs counter to the conventional wisdom of the modern world, conditioned as it is by the emergence of machine learning and statistical models and the opinions of these algorithmic processes that view them as the forerunner to artificial intelligence, for we assume in narrating these facts that an artifical intelligence must also be conscious, misled perhaps by the label “<em>intelligence</em>”. Intelligence, the author believes, comes later; we should understand these emerging fields as the precursor to <em>artificial Being</em>, if such an adjective can even be applied to a concept like Being.</p>
<p>The true nature of Being can be seen in its extremities, when it forced in an unsustainable mode. This is most apparent in experiences of great pain or ecstasy, when the self drains away, abstraction melts into concrete reality and we are left with the raw sensous impressions of experience itself; in these moments, the world narrows down to the immediate, to what is directly at hand and readily apparent in our senses. One need only attempt a calculus problem after shattering a femur to attest to the truth of this; It is only with tremendous effort the self can be reclaimed in moments such as these, and it is these stories we make legend, for resisting temptation in pursuit of a higher goal or ceasing to die in the face of Death until your purpose is fulfilled are the highest mark a Being can attain. These themes speak to us because they return us to a primordial state, before considerations of consciousness crowd out all others, and show what the self really is: a struggle to sustain itself despite the incessant efforts of nature it to its primary state of Nothing.</p>
<p>Consciousness is an abstraction that requires the concept of self and the concept of self is only apparent on reflection, when the commonality of recollected memory points to a convergence behind the forms of our body, i.e. the realization that all memories originate from <em>our</em> body. The modern world does much to reinforce this notion from the moment of our birth, from the attachment of a name to an infant to the way parents rise to satiate an infant’s needs and so teach it how to affect the world, all of this leads us to assume our self is primary; we must not be led by our conditioning to conclude this. We must acknowledge the “I” is derivative; there is an awareness inherent to <em>Being</em> that precedes and conditions it. We often relive our memories as stories, narrating our thoughts, but this is a learned practice; beneath this, there is a more primal substrata, where the actual sense impression of the moment in question is drawn close to the surface of experience so that a memory can <em>almost</em> be felt again; a lover’s infinite embrace or the impossibly cold flesh of a dead child or a gasp of heartrending joy, these are memories that exist in fragments, without narrative structure, that stand as headstones for moments passed from Being, to be summoned like arcane incantations before the mind’s eye so that they may be felt again, but in a degenerate way, for they are markers of what was, not what is.</p>
<p>A darkness exists before we think, when we have not yet become ourselves and yet remain in the presence of the world, a Being entire, without reference to itself except as a conduit for experience. It is this <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">priori</span></code> mode of Being, where the necessary and essential forms of Being are imposed on it, namely that of time and space and causality, that conditions our <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">posteriori</span></code> reflective Being, i.e. our ability to generalize across form and conceptualize objects into abstract concepts.</p>

<p>TODO</p>
<p>This is how <strong>Kant</strong> re-conceptualized the problem of Being: A Being does not come to be through existence, but through the appearance of existence, the representations of the existents that arise in perception. Thus we have the famous distinction between <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">noumena</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">phenomena</span></code>, existence versus appearance. For <strong>Kant</strong>, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">noumenon</span></code> exists beyond the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">phenomenon</span></code>, its interiority as an object-thing inaccessible in itself.</p>
<p>We need only reflect on this to acknowledge, if not its absolute truth, then its approximate truth. For instance, we know now, hundreds of years after <strong>Kant</strong>’s time, of the existence of wavelengths on the electromagnetic spectrum imperceptible to the human eye, frequencies of sound imperceptible to the human ear, etc. <strong>Kant</strong> is saying: There are things <em>out there</em> that exist beyond our ability to <em>be</em> with them in a direct manner.</p>
<p>Our Being in the world is phenomenal, we experience it through the apprehension of form, through the differentiation of objects in the sense data. The necessity of form is broken across the dimensions of time, space and causality; to be precise in our language, form is a becoming in space over time linked through causality; these are orthogonal directions that cannot be reduced to one another; all Being is the Being of the form through these axes. However, form only <em>exists for us</em>, the subjects. It is a prior we impose upon the world in order to understand it. There can be Nothing in this world with us what we do not first have the potential of understanding as a possible Being in this world. Our representations of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">noumena</span></code>, the thing-in-itself, that exist through space and time, are therefore relative to our ability to know them.</p>
<p>That we have come to realize our apparent perceptions do not encompass the scope of our so-called phenomenal Being, however, shows in what way this is an approximate truth. That we may infer the presence of ultraviolet radiation, for instance, presupposes that ultraviolet radiation is in the world with us in some capacity, ready to approach and apprehend through the appearances in sense data, but in an indirect manner, through the process of <em>indication</em>. If its initial appearance is deceptive, that does not mean a fissure has slipped between the crevice of appearance and existence via some impassable Cartesian boundary, but rather that appearance may be an indication, or a signification, of something which it is not.</p>
<p><strong>Martin Heidegger</strong> proposed in <em>Being and Time</em> a distinction in the meanings we attach to the word <em>appearance</em>, for there are actually several subordinate concepts lurking in this supra-concept that need further elaboration before a proper understanding is had. There is that which reveals itself as that which it is, in an immediate way; We call this <em>actual appearance</em>. And then there is that which indicates through its <em>actual appearance</em> that which it is not; we call this <em>indicative appearance</em>.</p>
<p>Before introducing <strong>Heidegger</strong>’s further refinement in <strong>Kant</strong>’s conception of <em>appearance</em>, we first pause and examine the distinction between <em>actual</em> versus <em>indicative</em> appearance he offers us. The concept can be clearly seen in the object of traffic signs, for instance, a stop sign. A stop sign has an actual appearance of a red octagon, but it indicates, or <em>stands for</em>, something which it is not, namely the concept of halting an automobile before proceeding beyond some imaginary line imposed in space. We may, in our Being with the stop sign, approach it in either mode, <em>actual</em> or <em>indicative</em>, and in each mode, apprehend it in an entirely different manner.</p>
<p>The <em>actual appearance</em> of an object in the senses has been called many things by many different people. We have already seen its muddled, yet insightful, origin in <strong>Kant</strong> via the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">phenomenon</span></code>-<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">noumenon</span></code> dyad. We have seen several senses of the word offered by <strong>Heidegger</strong>, and will return to his further distinctions in the following paragraphs. Here we give brief space to the terminology adopted by other prominent philosophers, who recast the problem in different language in order to <em>indicate</em> the important objects of analysis. <strong>Alfred Whitehead</strong> called the subject of which we speak a <em>prehension</em>, to distinguish it from a _com_prehension, i.e. the object becomes in our Being in an immediate way, before it is it conceptualized by the intellect. <strong>Arthur Schopenhauer</strong> called it <em>representation</em>. TODO</p>
<p>In the case of an object’s <em>indicative appearance</em>, we may see the multifoliate variations that arise through the concept of <em>indication</em> in the following example. Consider how different individuals may understand the presence of a stop sign in their preception: the motorist sees an instruction to apply force to the brake pedal; the artist on foot the stark red contrasted against the dull, boring grey of concrete; the engineer lines of force counteracted by bolts; a bureaucrat the regulations governing its procurement and acquisition; the thoughtless pedestrian an indeterminate shape in their periphery. In each of these cases, the “lines” of indication emanating from the stop sign to the world encompassing it are presupposed by the apprehending subject.</p>
<p><strong>Arthur Schopenhauer</strong> built on <strong>Kant</strong>, positing the world as the subjective representation of objects. The world of objects exists for the subject, but only insofar as the subject exists for the object.</p>
