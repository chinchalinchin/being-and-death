# Being and Death

## The Stage 

The selection of a title for this work has gone through several revisions:

- _Death_
- _The Phenomenology of Death_
- _The Ontology of Death_
- _Towards an Ontology of Death_
- _A Critique of Being_
- _The Death in Philosophy_
- _The Death of Philosophy_
- _The Philosopher's Suicide Note_
- _Solipsism and Inevitability_
- _The Misanthropy of Human Being_
- _The Horror of Death_
- _The Twisting of the Screw_

Of these, the only one the author truly feels remorse for not selecting is the last. If the reader should find the current title lacking, perhaps they will find solace in this alternative, _The Twisting of the Screw_, as the author feels simply reading this is sufficient to understand the contents it encloses. 

The current title, _Being and Death_, is meant as an allusion to those monoliths of philosophy few people claim to have read and even less to have understood, e.g. _Being and Time_, _Being and Nothingness_, _Being and Event_, _Process and Reality_, etc. The author unfortunately counts himself among the former group, but lacks the hubris to claim membership to the latter. In this, there lurks the motivation for what the reader now finds in their hands. By putting his thoughts to paper, he sought to understand what it these authors were getting at and in doing so believes he has found a problem lurking in their formulations. This work is an attempt to elaborate that problem. It should be clear, even at this early stage and without further exploration, what that problem is.

Some of these titles not selected have been used as the headings of sections and subsections, indicating the scope of the current project outstripped the author's original intent. For that, he apologizes. If he knew at the beginning all of this would amount to so many countless words no one will ever read, he probably still would have written them, but done so with more evident despair. 

From this list of titles it should be obvious the thesis of the present work. If the author is granted one contribution to the annals of philosophy, let it be the proof of the futility of all future philosophies. Forever after let us cast the would-be philosophers from great heights to end their miserable lives on the rocks below. If that be too ambitious, then let the contribution be atleast as a footnote affixed to everything that follows: "_Yes, but who cares?_" 

In constructing such a proof, we shall adhere to the grand tradition of philosophy and arbitrarily capitalize some concepts and not others to denote their precise meaning in the following discourse, foremost among these: _Being_, _Nothing_, _Other_ and _Death_. We do this for no other reason but because, in the inimitable words of the twentieth century's greatest philsopher, **Bill Waterson**, we "_must obey the inscrutable exhortions of (the) soul_".

If the preceding lacks clarity, then let us rephrase more flippantly, in the hopes colloquialism will excite in the reader an appropriate vision of what is to come: _philosophy should tremble before the horror of Death as we do_.

## The Question

**Albert Camus** once stated there is but one philosophical question and that is suicide. In this, **Camus** skipped over much to arrive at his starting point. However, to his credit, he only meant it in the rhetorical sense, as way to examine the absurdity of living in a universe where you are fated from the very start to die at the end. Nevertheless, there is a definite proximity to truth in his formulation of the so-called "_philosophical question_". 

Death is the bedrock at the bottom of Being. As such, we are condemned to die simply by Being. Whether we die in ignorance or with full awareness of our mortality matters not to Death, because Death is not something that _cares_[^1]. From this and because of this, all things proceed. 

A Being cannot _be_ without the phantom of Death haunting its every step through time. Only in the sequel, once reflective consciousness[^2] enters into the equation, do we ask whether or not a life always imperilled is worth living.

Despite being the foundation of almost every human pathology, Death as a field of inquiry has received comparatively little analysis over the course of history, except in the medical sciences where it is treated clinically, i.e. as a `thing-in-itself`, to be catalogued and diagnosed along with all the other maladies and diseases and thus placed into a knowable relation with the rest of existence, or in the spiritual studies, where it is mythologized and understood only through metaphor, never as an experience that happens _to_ us.

There is a reason for this. Death as a subject is repellant to understanding. Its very definition presupposes the limit of the knower; That is to say, Death is inherently unknowable. Death can only be understood through the mechanisms of analogy and metaphor, via the circuituous and torturous route of symbolism, for when we turn our attention directly to the object of Death it reveals itself as something which can not be found in Being. 

We can be aware that we will eventually die, we can perceive others passing from this world of existence, we can even in unique circumstances perceive the manner of our own Death, but that awareness will never be extended into Death itself. Death is the point where awareness stops, if by "_awareness_" we mean `Being-in-the-world` (<sup><sub>see [below](#being)</sub></sup>). 

In this way, we mean Death exists beyond the limit of understanding; to make the relationship thus denoted more clear, we might coin the term `understanding-of-the-world`[^3], and posit Death as that which removes this from Being, and thus annihiliates Being. We see, as a result of the unknowability of Death, how the ontological necessity between Being and knowledge emerges. The provisional aim of this work is to show this unknowability ontologically precedes and conditions that of Being. Death, in its unknowability, illuminates. 

Death then, while unapproachable, becomes a way to understand our own Being, for it shows us the domain of the problem, the problem being what it means _to be_. Death is `a priori` to Being, baked into all ontologies, even if they do not explicitly acknowledge it as such. _To be_ inherently contains the possibility of _not Being_. The `invariance` of Death is a fundamental constant of nature and thus provides the metric by which to [unpack existence into representative form](./02_towards_an_ontology_of_death.md#death-as-not-object). 

To ask questions about a subject that perpetually recedes from all attempts to know it necessarily entails the admission up front that no answers can ever be conceived, much less perceived. The inevitable end result will be to arrive where we started, having gained Nothing, except perhaps understanding of what it means to be futile, which will anyway evaporate when we die; If any proposition can lay claim to human nature, this is it. 

It would seem, then, it does not matter which direction we choose to go, since we will always return to our starting point, no better or worse for having made the circuit. For this reason, the author recommends no one should read what follows. Instead, the reader is advised that going outside is by far a better course of action.

[^1]: As if often the case when playing the exisentialist language game, we adopt the **Heideggerian** sense of the word _care_, or _concern_, i.e. the way in which a conscious Being orients itself in the world, or the manner in which we are drawn into the world, so that we might engage with it. 

[^2]: `reflective consciousness` as opposed to `ontical consciousness`; i.e. the consciousness of being conscious versus being conscious. This is what **Heidegger** called the split between _ontology_ and _onticity_. The human, or more generally, the `Dasein`, is a type of Being which is capable of reflecting on its Being. 

[^3]: We add here the caveat the terminology so far introduced is not yet a complete and exhaustive description of the ontological relations being examined. Throughout the course of the present, we will attempt to elucidate what it means _to be_ in relation to Death; this neologism is the first many we will formulate, as the primary function of philosophy seems to be the production of esoteric phrases. 

## The Currrent State of Being

With the warnings of futility thus dispensed, we will precede our discourse with a brief tour through the current state of our understanding of what it means _to be_. If Death can be said to be anything, then it must be as a negation of Being, i.e. _to not be_. Therefore, we first examine what is negated in Death to bring the scope of the problem into view. This will necessarily entail a brief discussion of the history of philosophy and what has led to our current understanding. What is presented in the next sections is by no means an exhaustive commentary, but only meant to highlight concepts as they pertain to the current analysis.

The maturity of a field of inquirty can be seen in where its crises occur. Mathematics, by far the most mature of the sciences, took more than two thousand years to move past the crises in its theorems, e.g. the determination of areas, the calculation of ratios, the solution of equations, etc., before finally grappling with the crises in its foundations, i.e. notions of primitives and Number, of Infinity, of completeness and consistency (<sup><sub>or the inherent lack thereof</sub></sup>), etc.

Philosophy, too, has recently come to grapple with it foundations. The crisis to be found in the current state of philsophy is mostly clearly seen in the vague division between metaphysics and ontology. There is no general consensus as to what constitutes the subject matter of one versus the other. In the following sections, we will focus our attention on this vagueness, so it might be dispersed and replaced with clarity. We will do so by recounting our curent understanding of the problem of _Being_, pointing out as we go along how the fields of ontology and metaphysics emerge naturally from considerations of _Being_.

### Being

What does it mean _to be_? This is by no means a simple question, even though we answer it every day simply by not being dead. That we _are_ means we must, to some extent, possess the answer to this question, but it is not at all clear how we should put that answer into words. 

The meaning of _Being_ is transfused with our everyday intuition, with our immediate apprehension of the world outside ourselves. We use _Being_ in a variety of contexts: The rock _is_ heavy, the mountain _is_ high, love _is_ delightful, red _is_ pretty, the idea _was_ disgusting, I _am_ hesitant, you _are_ reading, he _was_ sick, the teacher _was_ doubtful, and so on, ad infinitum. It would seem, then, _Being_ must be a broad concept to encompass so wide an array of phenomenon. How are we to preserve its meaning across its diverse usage? To put another way, _am_ I the same way a rock _is_?

Often, _Being_ is colloquially equated with that of _existence_, but this is not quite right. The error results from a misunderstanding of semantics, as seen in the contrived syntax, "_The rock is_". Here we are led along the path of a syntactically correct sentence to a semantic meaning that does not correspond to reality, i.e. the rock _is_, without reference to anything else, as if Being were something that did not require a ground to draw it into repose. 

Among the greatest of **Martin Heidegger**'s many insights is his realization the relation of Being contains within it an implicit reference to the world in which to the thing/entity/being is. For this reason, he introduced the term, `Being-in-the-world`, as a way of drawing the reader's attention towards the implicit ontological relations contained in our concept of Being. The _world_ in this neologism is not the world of space and time, although that is one aspect of it, but a world of everything that exists, including the possibility of that existence.



_Being_ is a relation. This relation implicitly contains the world and the entity that relates to the world. It is the way in which an existent entity is in the world. 
 

Our Being, and the Being of all other entities, is recursive in this sense: It contains an implicit reference to itself. We are, in so far, that we can be in relation to ourselves. The rock is the rock, I am I, you are you. Do not conclude these propositions are nonsense, haphazard permutations of syntax. Instead, they should be perceived for what they are: tautological trivialities, a form of ontological identity. fR

**Heidegger** conceptualized a type of Being called `Dasein`, in order to distinguish it from the types of being possessed by things like plants, rocks, numbers or concepts. Our Being is such that it is concerned with its Being. Our Being is with respect to the forms it apprehends, an apprehension of forms that necessarily contains within it the form that is apprehending.

**Heidegger** acknowledges the split between ontology and metaphysics, rightly giving priority, as its relates it us and our experience of ourselves, to ontology over metaphysics. Nevertheless, in supposing a characteristic separation between the properties of our Being and the properties of the Being of things, he tacitly assumes a metaphysical theorem _about_ Being in the construction of his ontology, namely that the Being of some entities, such as rocks and asteroids, are not concerned with their Being. This seems a likely hypothesis, and one cannot fault **Heidegger** for its assumption if he were conducting himself in his everyday routines, but when doing philosophy, we must be explicit in acknowledging our priors.

The hypothesis is alluring, for it appears self-evident. It would seem to be the case our Being is distinct from other Beings of a certain species or genre. It is apparent that we, as humans, have unique properties that distinguish us from, say, a park bench. Appearances, however, are no foundation for an ontological philosophy. So that is all it can remain: a hypothesis. It is a prior assumption we bring to the table over and above the ontic priors we implicitly bring with us into our apprehensions, the very priors we are trying to discern in the construction of any ontology. 

If we build a top of a mixture 

How are we to separate the consequences of our assumptions, the consequences of our priors, and the variations with respect to one another? If the ontological pursuit is understood as the removal of `factical` priors from our understanding of Being, then we must not allow ourselves to be fooled into thinking there is a basis for the differentiation of Being into partitions. Heidegger means as much when he talks about the "unity" of Being.


Death is a proposition about form: that it will cease be. 

### Metaphysics

There is a case to be made that **Gottlob Frege**'s _Foundations of Arithmetic_ is the first truly metaphysical treatise, despite all that preceded it and claimed the title[^5]. In this work, he provides a philosophical basis for Number through an analysis of the terms: `object`, `concept` and `relation`. [^4] He defines the number "_0_" and the number "_1_" in the following way[^6]

---

```
The number 0 belongs to a concept if, whatever object considered, the proposition holds universally this object exists in that concept.
```

---

---

```
The number 1 belongs to a concept if, whatever object considered, the proposition does not hold universally this object does not exist that concept.
```

---

Within these two definitions, **Frege** has provided an immediately comprehensible way of defining Number as that which make assertions about the _cardinality_ of sets of existent things. The profundity of this should not be ignored, for what **Frege** has shown here is Number is metaphysical[^7], i.e. Number is not a property _of_ a thing, but a proposition _about_ things. 

**Frege** is telling us: do not confuse the `factical` origin of numbers, i.e. abstraction, for the existence of Number. Since the term `factic` has not yet been introduced into the present discourse, we will give examples of possible `factic` origins of numbers that will make the preceding clear: consider three bicycles or twelve eggs or a hundred Senators or a ten thousand soldiers. The "_numberness_" we perceive is not there, _in_ the objects to which Number is affixed. For instance, the sensory impression of a carton of eggs does not contain in and of itself the concept of twelve; our experience is the immediate apprehension of the world in a way that tells us what _is_ before us and with us in the world.

Number is something that arrives through Being, but is independent of Being, except insofar that it is what the representations of certain Beings are about. Number is a metaphysical orthogonality in existence, an absolute metric that scales and ascribes itself to particular existents.

To approach the metaphysical nature of Number from different angle, consider how it is we apprehend five fingers and one hand simultaneously, via its appearance as appendage. The thing simply _is_; Number provides order and relation from above, as it were. The perceptions of five fingers and one hand are coincident, but the conceptions are not. Or, if you prefer **Kantian** language, the appearances overlap, but the phenomena are distinct[^8].

Thus, we might say Number is an "_phenomenon_" revealed over and above appearance. We might call it _epiphenomenal_, if this term were not loaded with materialistic and psychological undertones; Calling Number epiphenomenal would imply, through syllogism, its dependence on the existent world. Instead, we say Number is metaphysical to denote its truth without `contingency`, i.e.. 



[^4] Although in this sense, **Kant**'s title of _Prologmena to any Future Metaphysics_ is quite adapt.
[^5]: Frege would say `function` or `signify` instead of `relation`.
[^6]: We have modified the terminology here slightly from **Frege**'s actual definition. In the case of zero, the original definition reads, "the number 0 belongs to a concept if, whatever _a_ may be, the proposition holds universally that _a_ does not fall under that concept". The substitution of object for _a_ should be no cause for concern, otherwise what use is a variable? However the equivalence of _does not fall under_ to _does not exist_ deserves a further remark. **Frege**'s goal was to complete the universal language proposed by **Leibniz**, a goal that requires utter precision. The author thought it best to remove the ambiguity of "_falling_" from **Frege**'s definition, as this definition was taken from a translation, and the so-called "_sense_" of the current definition seems more in keeping with the purpose of the original project. Regardless, the current work is not meant as a commentary on **Frege**, or any philosopher for that matter.
[^7]: **Frege** would say `objective` instead of `metaphysical`, but here again we edit in modern terminology. The term `objective` shall be used the sense intended by **Schopenhauer**, in later sections.
[^8]: This signals a missing dimension to **Kant**'s rough draft of ontology of `noumena` vs `phenomena`. In other words, appearance and phenomena are not identical, for there are phenomenal apprehensions that do not reside in the appearances we attach to the world. This is one of **Frege**'s greatest contributions to philosophy. 

### Concept



## Proof by Contradiction

The great workhorse of mathematics is proof by contradiction. An assumption is made, an absurdity is shown to result from the assumption, therefore the assumption is shown to be false. In this way was modern mathematics constructed, by outlining the truth and demarcating its boundary with falsity. Anyone who has studied higher mathematics will attest to the way most mathematical proofs work by letting the truth "_in through the back door_"[^4], that is to say, they work by showing what cannot be the case in order to prove the opposite must be so, but this gets us no closer to _why_ it is so.

This method does not reveal the "_intuition_" of the theorem to the observer; indeed one can comprehend a proof without understanding anything about what it trying to say and in the converse direction, one may understand a concept without being able to grasp its proof in the slightest.

So it is with induction: a proof of induction, and therefore a proof _by_ induction, relies on a contradiction that an element belongs to two mutually exclusive sets, which we are forced to admit is absurdity, therefore we conclude induction must be true; but nowhere in the proof do we see why the form in an induced series is transmitted from one term to the next. Likewise, a student can spend an entire academic career studying the axioms and theorems of real analysis and still have no intuition for how a falling stone's trajectory traces a parabola with respect to time, despite having memorized a series of proofs that show how to go from set theory to differential calculus.

This, however, is a logical method well-suited for Death, since as we have noted, Death will never be understood. The only course we may avail ourselves of is to define what Death is not and trace its outline through the ink of negation. Indeed, this will be the course of the present work. We shall attempt to negate our way towards an understanding of Death, an understanding that we have already noted is impossible. _C'est la vie_.
