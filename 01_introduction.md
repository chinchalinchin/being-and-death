# Being and Death

## The Stage 

The selection of a title for this work has gone through several revisions:

- _Death_
- _The Phenomenology of Death_
- _The Ontology of Death_
- _Towards an Ontology of Death_
- _A Critique of Being_
- _The Death in Philosophy_
- _The Death of Philosophy_
- _Philosophy's Suicide Note_
- _Solipsism and Inevitability_
- _The Misanthropy of Human Being_
- _The Horror of Death_
- _The Twisting of the Screw_

Of these, the only one the author truly feels remorse for not selecting is the last. If the reader should find the current title lacking, perhaps they will find solace in this alternative, _The Twisting of the Screw_, as the author feels simply reading this is sufficient to understand the contents it encloses. 

The current title, _Being and Death_, is meant as an allusion to those monoliths of philosophy few people claim to have read and even less to have understood, e.g. _Being and Time_, _Being and Nothingness_, _Being and Event_, _Process and Reality_, etc. The author unfortunately counts himself among the former group, but lacks the hubris to claim membership to the latter. In this, there lurks the motivation for what the reader now finds in their hands. 

Some of these titles not selected have been used as the headings of sections and subsections, indicating the scope of the current project outstripped the author's original intent. For that, he apologizes. If he knew at the beginning all of this would amount to so many countless words no one will ever read, he probably still would have written them, but done so with more evident despair. 

From this list of titles it should be obvious the thesis of the present work. If the author is granted one contribution to the annals of philosophy, let it be the proof of the futility of all future philosophies. Forever after let us cast the would-be philosophers from great heights to end their miserable lives on the rocks below. If that be too ambitious, then let the contribution be atleast as a footnote affixed to everything that follows: "_Yes, but what is does it matter?_" 

In constructing such a proof, we shall adhere to the grand tradition of philosophy and arbitrarily capitalize some concepts and not others to denote their precise meaning in the following discourse, foremost among these: _Being_, _Life_, _Nothing_, _Other_ and _Death_. We do this for no other reason but because, in the inimitable words of the twentieth century's greatest philsopher, **Bill Waterson**, we "_must obey the inscrutable exhortions of (the) soul_".

If the preceding lacks clarity, then let us rephrase more flippantly, in the hopes colloquialism will excite in the reader an appropriate vision of what is to come: _philosophy should tremble before the horror of Death as we do_.

And the end of all our exploring
Will be to arrive where we started
And know the place for the first time

## The Question

**Albert Camus** once stated there is but one philosophical question and that is suicide. In this, **Camus** skipped over much to arrive at his starting point. However, to his credit, he only meant it in the rhetorical sense, as way to examine the absurdity of living in a universe where you are fated from the very start to die at the end. Nevertheless, there is a definite proximity to truth in his formulation of the so-called "_philosophical question_". 

Death is the bedrock at the bottom of Being. As such, we are condemned to die simply by Being. Whether we die in ignorance or with full awareness of our mortality matters not to Death, because Death is not something that _cares_[^1]. From this and because of this, all things proceed. 

A Being cannot _be_ without the phantom of Death haunting its every step through time. Only in the sequel, once reflective consciousness[^2] enters into the equation, do we ask whether or not a life always imperilled is worth living.

Despite being the foundation of almost every human pathology, Death as a field of inquiry has received comparatively little analysis over the course of history, except in the medical sciences where it is treated clinically, i.e. as a `thing-in-itself`, to be catalogued and diagnosed along with all the other maladies and diseases and thus placed into a knowable relation with the rest of existence, or in the spiritual studies, where it is mythologized and understood only through metaphor, never as an experience that happens _to_ us. Rare are the personalities like **Nietzsche**, **Bataille** or **Cioran**, who confront Death as it is, without the window dressing of ideology or assumption.

There is a reason for this. Death as a subject is repellant to understanding. Its very definition presupposes the limit of the knower; That is to say, Death is inherently unknowable. Death can only be understood through the mechanisms of analogy and metaphor, via the circuituous and torturous route of symbolism, for when we turn our attention directly to the object of Death it reveals itself as something which can not be found in Being. 

We can be aware that we will eventually die, we can perceive others passing from this world of existence, we can even in unique circumstances perceive the manner of our own Death, but that awareness will never be extended into Death itself. Death is the point where awareness stops, if by "_awareness_" we mean `Being-in-the-world`. 

In this way, we mean Death exists beyond the limit of understanding; to make relationship thus denoted more clear, we might coin the term `understanding-of-the-world`[^3], and posit Death as that which removes this from Being, and thus annihiliates Being. We see, as a result of the unknowability of Death, how the ontological necessity between Being and knowledge emerges. Death, in its unknowability, illuminates. 

Death then, while unapproachable, becomes a way to understand our own Being, for it shows us the domain of the problem, the problem being what it means _to be_. Death is `a priori` to Being, baked into all ontologies, even if they do not explicitly acknowledge it as such. _To be_ inherently contains the possibility of _not Being_. The `invariance` of Death is a fundamental constant of nature and thus provides the metric by which to [unpack existence into representative form](#death-as-not-object). 

To ask questions about a subject that perpetually recedes from all attempts to know it necessarily entails the admission up front that no answers can ever be conceived, much less perceived. The inevitable end result will be to arrive where we started, having gained Nothing, except perhaps understanding of what it means to be futile, which will anyway evaporate when we die; If any proposition can lay claim to human nature, this is it. 

It would seem, then, it does not matter which direction we choose to go, since we will always return to our starting point, no better or worse for having made the circuit. For this reason, the author recommends no one should read what follows. Instead, the reader is advised that going outside is by far a better course of action.

[^1]: As if often the case when playing the exisentialist language game, we adopt the **Heideggerian** sense of the word _care_, or _concern_, i.e. the way in which a conscious Being orients itself in the world, or the manner in which we are drawn into the world, so that we might engage with it. 

[^2]: `reflective consciousness` as opposed to `ontical consciousness`; i.e. the consciousness of being conscious versus being conscious. This is what **Heidegger** called the split between _ontology_ and _onticity_. The human, or more generally, the `Dasein`, is a type of Being which is capable of reflecting on its Being. 

[^3]: We add here the caveat the terminology so far introduced is not yet a complete and exhaustive description of the ontological relations being examined. Throughout the course of the present, we will attempt to elucidate what it means _to be_ in relation to Death; this neologism is the first many we will formulate, as the primary function of philosophy seems to be the production of esoteric phrases. 

## The Currrent State of Being

With the warnings of futility thus dispensed, we will precede our discourse with a brief tour through the current state of our understanding of what it means _to be_. If Death can be said to be anything, then it must be a negation of Being, i.e. _to not be_. Therefore, we first examine what is negated in Death to bring the scope of the current problem into view.

The maturity of a field of inquirty can be seen in where its crises occur. Mathematics, by far the most mature of the sciences, took more than two thousand years to move past the crises in its theorems, e.g. the determination of areas, the calculation of ratios, the solution of equations, etc., before finally grappling with the crises in its foundations, i.e. notions of primitives and Number, of Infinity, of completeness and consistency (<sup><sub>or the inherent lack thereof</sub></sup>), etc.

Philosophy, too, has recently come to grapple with it foundations, passing through the crucible of ethics and morality into pure metaphysics and ontology. 

### Being

What does it mean _to be_? This is by no means a simple question, even though we answer it every day simply by not being dead. That we _are_ means we must, to some extent, possess the answer to this question, but it is not at all clear how we should put that answer to words. 

The meaning of _Being_ is transfused with our everyday intuition, with our immediate apprehension of the world outside ourselves. We use _Being_ in a variety of contexts: The rock is heavy, the mountain is high, love is a pleasure, the idea was disgusting, I am hesitant, you are reading, he was sick, etc. It would seem, then, _Being_ must be a broaden concept to encompass so wide an array of phenomenon. How are we to preserve its meaning across its diverse usage?

_Being_ is colloquially equated with that of _existence_, but this is not quite right. 



_Being_ is a relation. This relation implicitly contains the world and the entity that relates to the wrodl. It is the way in which an existent entity is in the world. Being is with respect to the forms it apprehends, an apprehension of forms that necessarily contains within it the form that is apprehending.

Our Being, and the Being of all other entities, is recursive in this sense. It contains a reference to itself. We are, in so far, that we can be in relation to ourselves

**Heidegger** conceptualized this type of Being as `Dasein`, in order to distinguish it from the types of being possed by things like plants, rocks, numbers or concepts. Our Being is such that it is concerned with its Being.

**Heidegger** acknowledges the split between ontology and metaphysics, rightly giving priority, as its relates it us and our experience of ourselves, to ontology over metaphysics. Nevertheless, in supposing a characteristic separation, i.e. a difference in properties, between our Being and things, he implicitly references a metaphysical theorem in the construction of his ontology, namely that the being of some entities, such as rocks and asteroids, are not concerned with their Being. This seems a likely hypothesis, and one cannot fault **Heidegger** for its assumption if he were conducting himself in his everyday routines, but when doing philosophy, we must be explicit in acknowledging our priors.

The hypothesis is alluring, for it is self-evident. It would seem to be the case our Being is distinct from other Beings of a certain species or genre. It is apparent that we, as humans, have unique properties that distinguish us from, say, a park bench. Appearances, however, are no foundation for an ontology. So that is all it can remain: a hypothesis. It is a prior assumption we bring to the table over and above the ontic priors we implicitly bring with us into our apprehensions, the very priors we are trying to discern in the construction of any ontology. 

If we build a top of a mixture 

How are we to separate the consequences of our assumptions, the consequences of our priors, and the variations with respect to one another? If the ontological ursity is understood as the removal of factical priors from our understanding of Being, then we must not allow ourselves to be fooled into thinking there is a basis for the differentiation of Being into partitions. Heidegger means as much when he talks about the "unity" of Being.


Death is a proposition about form: that it will cease be. 


### Through Being 


## Proof by Contradiction

The great workhorse of mathematics is proof by contradiction. An assumption is made, an absurdity is shown to result from the assumption, therefore the assumption is shown to be false. In this way was modern mathematics constructed, by outlining the truth and demarcating its boundary with falsity. Anyone who has studied higher mathematics will attest to the way most mathematical proofs work by letting the truth "_in through the back door_"[^4], that is to say, they work by showing what cannot be the case in order to prove the opposite must be so, but this gets us no closer to _why_ it is so.

This method does not reveal the "_intuition_" of the theorem to the observer; indeed one can comprehend a proof without understanding anything about what it trying to say and in the converse direction, one may understand a concept without being able to grasp its proof in the slightest.

So it is with induction: a proof of induction, and therefore a proof _by_ induction, relies on a contradiction that an element belongs to two mutually exclusive sets, which we are forced to admit is absurdity, therefore we conclude induction must be true; but nowhere in the proof do we see why the form in an induced series is transmitted from one term to the next. Likewise, a student can spend an entire academic career studying the axioms and theorems of real analysis and still have no intuition for how a falling stone's trajectory traces a parabola with respect to time, despite having memorized a series of proofs that show how to go from set theory to differential calculus.

This, however, is a logical method well-suited for Death, since as we have noted, Death will never be understood. The only course we may avail ourselves of is to define what Death is not and trace its outline through the ink of negation. Indeed, this will be the course of the present work. We shall attempt to negate our way towards an understanding of Death, an understanding that we have already noted is impossible. _C'est la vie_.
